# Beyond All Reason: Frontline Strategy Guide

## Introduction
This guide focuses on frontline strategies in Beyond All Reason (BAR), based on high-level gameplay analysis. It covers essential concepts, unit compositions, and economic management for frontline players.

## Role of the Frontliner

### Primary Responsibilities
1. Defend the backline
2. Harass enemy backliners
3. Maintain map control
4. Establish and hold strategic positions

## Early Game Strategy

### Opening Build Order
1. Single Max opening (Metal Extractor)
2. Wind Turbines (3x) when wind is high
   - Alternative: Solar Collectors when wind is low
3. Bot Lab placement
   - Initially place behind front line
   - Consider reclaiming and rebuilding closer to front later

### Initial Unit Composition
- 2x Ticks (Scout units)
- 3x Construction Bots
- Fleas (Light raiders)
- Pawns (Basic infantry)

## Mid Game Development

### Economic Management
1. Progressive Metal Extractor upgrades to Advanced Metal Extractors (AMEXs)
2. Energy Production Timeline:
   - Start with Wind Turbines/Solar
   - Transition to Fusion Reactors (aim for 3-4 before APHIS)
   - Add APHIS only after sufficient Fusion infrastructure

### Static Defense Layout

#### Tier 1 Defenses
- Light Laser Turrets (LLTs) for early protection
- Sentries for basic defense
- Construction Turrets for build support

#### Tier 2 Defenses
- Wardens for improved defense
- Pitbulls for stronger defensive positions
- Rattlesnakes (Cloakable pop-up plasma artillery)
- Arbalest (Anti-air defense, especially on map edges)

## Unit Progression

### Tier 1 Units
1. Early Game:
   - Fleas for harassment
   - Pawns for basic combat
   - Thugs for stronger pushing power

2. Mid Game:
   - Stouts (Vehicle) for mobile defense
   - Light Artillery for range advantage
   - Roccos/Rockets for static defense removal

### Tier 2 Units
1. Combat Units:
   - Gunslingers (Mavericks) for strong offensive power
   - Sharpshooters with Welder support
   - Hounds for mobility and harassment

2. Support Units:
   - Butlers (Advanced Construction Bots)
   - Lazarus for metal reclamation

## Advanced Tactics

### Pulsar Creep Strategy
1. Establish initial Pulsar position
2. Gradually advance additional Pulsars
3. Maintain defensive coverage
4. Use range advantage for map control

### Air Defense Strategy
1. Place Arbalest along map edges
2. Maintain radar coverage
3. Consider SARS for mobile anti-air
4. Position Dragon's Claws strategically

## Economy Tips

### Resource Management
1. Focus on incremental economic growth
2. Prioritize unit production over excessive eco
3. Fusion Reactor progression:
   - Aim for 3-4 Fusion Reactors before APHIS
   - Continue unit production while expanding
   - Consider reclaiming old energy structures

### Build Power
- Maintain 5-10 Butlers for frontline construction
- Balance between construction and combat units
- Position construction units safely behind defense lines

## Communication and Teamplay

### Key Points
1. Call for help when facing multiple opponents
2. Ping important developments
3. Coordinate with backliner for support
4. Communicate economy transfers when needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overextending without sufficient support
2. Building APHIS too early
3. Neglecting anti-air defense
4. Insufficient build power for frontline structures
5. Poor static defense positioning

## Advanced Unit Combinations

### Effective Compositions
1. Welder + Sharpshooter
2. Bulls + Mausers + Starlights
3. Razorbacks with Butler support
4. Thor with EMP capability

## Conclusion
Success as a frontliner requires balancing aggressive expansion with defensive positioning, while maintaining steady economic growth. Communication with teammates and proper unit composition are key to victory.
