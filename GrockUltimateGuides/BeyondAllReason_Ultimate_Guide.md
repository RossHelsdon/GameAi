## Section 2: Building Your Economy Foundation

### 2.1 Starting Economy Build Order
- **Initial Resources**: Start with 1000 **Metal** and 1000 **Energy**; prioritize production to avoid depletion (from Starting Economy).
- **Metal Extractors First**: Queue 2-3 **Metal Extractors** (500 **Energy** each) for **Commander** to build; balance energy needs (from Starting Economy & Frontline Quick Reference).
- **Energy Production (Wind-Dependent)**:
  - High Wind: Build 3 **Wind Turbines** (output varies; check map info card for min/max speed) (from Starting Economy & Frontline Guides).
  - Low/No Wind: Use **Solar Collectors** (constant output, no energy build cost); viable with 3 **Metal Extractors** (from Starting Economy & Frontline Guides).
  - Adapt Dynamically: If wind drops, hold Spacebar to prioritize a **Solar Collector** (from Starting Economy).
- **Metal Expansion**: Add more **Metal Extractors**, targeting richer spots (higher numbers in circles) for territory control (from Starting Economy & Frontline Strategy).
- **Variability Note**: Adapt builds to map-specific wind and metal conditions; no universal order exists (from Starting Economy).

### 2.2 Understanding Streaming Economy
- **Continuous Drain**: Resources drain from stockpiles, not in batches; monitor top screen bars (from Starting Economy).
- **Resource Bar Details**:
  - Green (Bottom): Income per second.
  - Bright Red (Top): Total spend (production + stockpile).
  - Other Red: Production spend only (bright red > other = stockpile drain).
  - Middle: Current stockpile.
  - Right: Max capacity (from Starting Economy).
- **Energy Conversion**: Convert excess **Energy** to **Metal** via **Energy Converters** (70:1 at T1); adjust white box on energy bar to manage usage (from Starting Economy).

### 2.3 Early Build Techniques

- **Construction Boost**: Build **Construction Turret** (200 build power boost in range) with **Constructor Bot**; auto-finishes projects (from Starting Economy).

## Section 3: Transition to Unit Production
- **First Facility**: Construct a **Bot Lab** (simpler for beginners over **Vehicle Lab**) for early units; consider **Aircraft Plant** for air focus after economy setup (from Starting Economy, Frontline Guides & Air Strategy Guide).
- **Unit Queue**: Pre-build queue in **Bot Lab**:
  - 1 **Constructor Bot** (extra build options).
  - 5 **Ticks**/**Fleas** (scouts, wide sight, hold Shift for bulk).
  - 3 more **Constructor Bots**.
  - 10 **Pawns**/**Grunts** (infantry, firepower/HP) (from Starting Economy & Frontline Guides).
- **Build Power**: Right-click **Bot Lab** with **Commander** to boost production (high energy cost; add energy builds if needed) (from Starting Economy).
- **Factory Dock**: Monitor and queue units via "Factory Dock" UI without returning to base (from Starting Economy).

## Section 4: Mastering the Frontline Role

### 4.1 Understanding Frontline Responsibilities
- **Dual Objectives**: Defend your backline to protect eco-focused players scaling to **T2** and **Fusion Reactors**; harass enemy backline to disrupt their economy (from Frontline Strategy Guide).
- **Edge Vulnerability**: Frontline positions, especially on map edges, lack immediate support; errors can lead to enemy breakthroughs (from Frontline Strategy Guide).

### 4.2 Core Frontline Build Order and Strategies
- **Early Game Setup**:
  - Queue 3 **Metal Extractors** and 3 **Wind Turbines**/**Solar Collectors** based on wind; build **Bot Lab** and 3 **Construction Bots** (from Frontline Quick Reference).
  - Move **Commander** to map middle by ~4:30 minutes for territory; scout with 2-3 **Ticks**/**Fleas**, react with 10 more if enemies spotted (from Frontline Guides).
- **Defensive Line**:
  - Place **Light Laser Turrets (LLTs)** at chokepoints; shield with **Commander** (immune to **D-Gun** post-update) (from Frontline Guides).
  - Build **Construction Turrets** near base with **Wind Turbines** in radius for build speed (from Frontline Guides).
  - Deploy frontline **Radar** for enemy backline visibility and flanking intel (from Frontline Guides).
- **Lane Defense**: Protect your lane (map edges riskier); avoid overextension (1v2/1v3 traps); seal gaps with scout intel (from Frontline Guides).
- **Resource Management**: Reclaim metal with **Lazarus** (e.g., 135 metal per action); upgrade to **Advanced Metal Extractors (Amaxes)**; delay **Aphis** until 3-4 **Fusion Reactors** (from Frontline Guides).

### 4.3 Unit Progression and Composition
- **Early Units**: Start with **Pawns**/**Grunts** for basic defense (from Frontline Guides).
- **Mid-Tier**: Transition to **Thugs** (stronger push, less range than **Roccos**); use **Roccos** vs. T1 defenses like **Sentries** (from Frontline Guides).
- **Vehicle Shift**: Adopt T1.5 **Vehicles** like **Stouts** (vs. fast **Hounds**) and **Light Artillery** (outranges most T1 defenses, not **The Gauntlet**) (from Frontline Guides).
- **Tier 2**: Request/build **T2 Bots** (e.g., **Gunslingers**) for strength; keep **Hounds** for mobility (from Frontline Guides).

## Section 5: Advanced Frontline Tactics and Teamplay

### 5.1 Static Defense Layers
- **Tiered Defenses**:
  - T1: **LLTs**/**Sentries** (weak vs. **Thugs**).
  - T1.5: **Wardens** (counter **Thugs**).
  - Mid-Game: **Pit Bulls** (strong range for passes).
  - T2: **Rattlesnakes** (cloakable plasma artillery, long range).
  - Late-Game: **Pulsars** (long-range, use "creep" with support); **Annihilators** (high damage) (from Frontline Guides).
- **Counterplay**: Match units to enemy defenses (e.g., **Light Artillery** vs. T1, loses to **Rattlesnakes**) (from Frontline Strategy).

### 5.2 Late-Game Scaling
- **Energy Scaling**: Build 3-4 **Fusion Reactors** before **Aphis** (4300 metal/1000 energy vs. 9700 metal) (from Frontline Guides).
- **Anti-Air**: Place **Obelisks** on edges vs. **Bombers**/**Valiants** (from Frontline Guides).
- **T3 Units**: Scale to **Thor** (EMP) or **Battle Mech**, supported by **Butlers** for fast builds (from Frontline Guides).
- **EMP Tactics**: Use **EMP Missile Launchers** to disable enemies for counterattacks (from Frontline Guides).

### 5.3 Communication and Teamplay
- **Request Help**: Ping "help 3v1" if overwhelmed; buying time for backline scaling is key (from Frontline Guides & Beginner Tips).
- **Support Allies**: Cover lanes if teammate **Commander** falls; use **Stouts**/**Hounds** for intercepts (from Frontline Guides).
- **Resource Sharing**: Transfer metal/energy via UI sliders (up to storage); share units like **T2 Constructors** (avoid accidental **Commander** transfer) (from Beginner Tips).
- **Tier Timing**: Avoid early **T2** (2900 metal for **Constructor**); wait ~10 minutes or reclaim; focus T1 facilities for cost efficiency (from Beginner Tips).

## Section 6: Mastering the Air Role

### 6.1 Understanding Air Responsibilities
- **Key Objectives**: As an air player, fulfill four critical roles—scout enemy positions with **Blinks**, catch ground raids with **Shurikens**, defend against air raids with **Fighters**, and kill with air using **Bombers** or gunships (from Air Strategy Guide).
- **Air Dominance Importance**: Without air support, your team is vulnerable to enemy air attacks; controlling the skies can win games (from Air Strategy Guide).

### 6.2 Core Air Build Order and Strategies
- **Early Game Setup**:
  - Opt for **Core** faction for strong air units like **Shuriken**; queue 3 **Metal Extractors** and 2 **Solar Collectors** for energy (air is energy-intensive) (from Air Strategy Guide).
  - Start with **Bot Lab** for flexibility (**Grunts** or **Lazarus**), then reclaim around 3 minutes to build **Aircraft Plant** if metal stalls (from Air Strategy Guide).
  - Queue 3 **Construction Bots**: First builds **Metal Extractor** and **Nano Turret** (cover **Maxes**); others build **Wind Turbines** in **Construction Turret** range (from Air Strategy Guide).
- **Early Air Production**:
  - Maintain 5:1 ratio of **Wind Turbines** to **Energy Converters**; keep energy slider high to avoid wind drop shutdowns (from Air Strategy Guide).
  - Queue 10 **Fighters** (e.g., **Falcons** for Core) as insurance against bombing runs or gunships (from Air Strategy Guide).
- **Scaling Economy**: Build **Energy Converters** for metal conversion; add **Nano Turrets** for build power; reclaim with **Lazarus** if metal tight (from Air Strategy Guide).
- **Delay T2**: Avoid own T2 lab (3200 metal for **Advanced Aircraft Plant**); buy T2 **Constructor Bot** (e.g., **Hercules**) from ally at ~7 minutes for **Advanced Metal Extractors (Amaxes)** (2.4 to 9.5 metal income) (from Air Strategy Guide).

### 6.3 Air Unit Progression and Tactics
- **T1 Units**: Start with T1 **Fighters** (strong **Arm T1 Fighter** for cost) for defense/scouting; use **Shurikens** (Core) on "Fly" mode to paralyze ground raids with fight commands (from Air Strategy Guide).
- **Bombers**: Build **Bombers** for backline attacks on **Metal Extractors** or facilities (from Air Strategy Guide).
- **T2 Units**: Transition to T2 **Nighthawks** (best Core fighters) for air control and stealth vs. defenses like **Mercury** (from Air Strategy Guide).
- **Fighter Wall**: Set patrol route near base with **Advanced Aircraft Plant**; repeat **Nighthawks** or T1 **Fighters** for bombing defense (from Air Strategy Guide).
- **Bombing Runs**: Spread **Bomber** damage with attack command (A key + drag right-click) over multiple targets; scout with **Blinks** for high-value areas (from Air Strategy Guide).

## Section 7: Multiplayer and Additional Tips
