# Beyond All Reason: Beginner Tips Quick Guide

This guide offers a concise, list-based overview of essential tips for new players of **Beyond All Reason**, derived from detailed transcripts of beginner advice. Use this reference to quickly grasp the basics of settings, hotkeys, commands, team play, unit details, game customization, and multiplayer setup to improve your gameplay experience.

## Game Settings for New Players
1. **Grid Optimized Hotkeys**: Enable under Controls > Grid Optimized Hotkeys for intuitive key bindings; customize further via Discord resources if needed.
2. **Set Target as Default**: Activate this option to prioritize right-click targets (e.g., enemy **Commander**) for units that attack while moving, avoiding wasted attacks on ground.
3. **Interface Preferences**:
   - Use the build grid menu (accessible with a selected builder like **Commander**) for easier structure placement; ideal for Starcraft players.
   - Enable "Always Show Prices", "Group Icon", and "Radar Icon" to display critical information about units and structures.
4. **Player List Visibility**: Keep the player list active to view your rank, open skill score (used for lobby balancing), and rank icon (similar to Starcraft 2 leagues).
5. **Mascot Selection**: Choose a mascot for personalization (no gameplay impact, just for fun).
6. **Icon Scale and Distance**: Adjust icon visibility to preference; icons help identify units like **Constructors** on the field (check website guides for icon meanings).
7. **Widgets and Extras**: Explore additional widgets and settings (e.g., DPS counts, defense ranges) for customization based on personal playstyle.
8. **Accessibility Options**: Under Accessibility, specify team color sharing (one color per team or unique per player) for visual clarity.

## Hotkeys and Commands
1. **Commander Shortcuts**:
   - **Ctrl+C**: Instantly find and select your **Commander** anywhere on the map.
   - **Ctrl+B**: Cycle through idle buildings and workers to manage inactive assets.
   - **F3**: Jump to the location of a ping or alert to respond quickly.
2. **Area Commands**: Issue commands to specific areas with Ctrl+Z or double-tap (e.g., build **Metal Extractors**, repair, attack, or reclaim in a dragged area).
3. **Reclaim Importance**: Reclaim map resources, own units, or enemy wrecks for metal income; critical early game (e.g., self-destructing **Commander** yields 2000 metal, avoid losing it to enemies).
4. **Repeat Command (T Key)**: Set repeat builds (e.g., repeat **Grunts**) or movements; combine with Shift+Q for repeated patrols under artillery fire.
5. **Queue Management**: Hold Alt to add a single unit (e.g., **Constructor**) to queue without repeating; issue commands to units mid-build (e.g., start **Advanced Fusion Reactor**).
6. **Select and Split Units**:
   - **Q**: Select all units of a type on screen (e.g., all **Mammoth Tanks** or **Grunts**).
   - **Ctrl+Q**: Split selected units into halves for tactical grouping (e.g., send some behind lines).
   - **Ctrl+Z or Double-Click**: Select all units of a type across the entire map with Ctrl+Z; double-click selects only those in view.
7. **Fight vs. Move Commands**: Use Fight command for backline units like artillery (stops when in range to attack); use Move for frontline units to keep firing while advancing.
8. **Drawing and Pings**: Hold Tilde+Q to draw on map for team communication; Tilde+Middle Click for specific pings; Tilde+Right Click to delete drawings.
9. **Camera Controls**:
   - Default Overhead Cam or flexible Spring Cam (rotate with Ctrl+Scroll for up/down, Alt for faster movement).
   - Ctrl+T for map overview; Ctrl+F7 hides UI for screenshots; Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+F2 resets camera.
   - Hold Alt and slide mouse to screen edge or use middle mouse button to change perspective.
10. **Idle Constructors**: Ctrl+Tap selects nearest idle **Constructor**; use Tab to select **Commander** directly.
11. **Auto Groups**: Hold Alt+Number to set auto groups (e.g., **Grunts** on 1, artillery on 2); persists between games; remove with Ctrl+Tilde.

## Commander Abilities and Tactics
1. **D-Gun (Hotkey D)**: For 500 energy, unleash a one-hit kill weapon with short range; avoid direct confrontation with experimental units due to range limitation.
2. **Cloak (Hotkey K)**: Cloak your **Commander** to become nearly invisible; costs minimal energy when still, more when moving; detectable by radar, countermeasures, or close enemies.
3. **Build Power**: **Commander** has the highest build power in the game; use it to assist critical projects for faster completion.
4. **Radar Range**: **Commander** has a green dotted radar range beyond line of sight; allows attacks into fog of war, though inaccurate without support.
5. **Self-Destruct (Ctrl+D)**: Detonate **Commander** or units for surprise damage against enemy swarms or to prevent metal reclamation by enemies; check explosion radius with Space+X (red rings for death, glowing for self-destruct).

## Team Game Basics
1. **Starting Location**: Choose a spot with at least 3 nearby **Metal Extractors**; edge positions for breakthroughs, backline for greedier eco (focus on units for new players).
2. **Pre-Game Build Setup**: Plan initial builds before game start (e.g., queue **Metal Extractors**).
3. **Resource Transfer**: Drag sliders in team UI to share metal/energy (up to teammate storage); avoid overbuilding storage early (1-2 for energy/metal is enough).
4. **Unit Sharing**: Double-click share icon to transfer selected units (e.g., **T2 Constructors** for better **Metal Extractors**); beware accidental **Commander** transfers.
5. **Tier 2 Timing**: Avoid rushing **T2** (2900 metal for **Constructor**); wait until ~10 minutes or reclaim a field unless doing a tech build (not recommended for beginners).
6. **Tier 1 Focus**: Build additional T1 facilities (e.g., add **Bot Lab** if started with **Vehicle Lab**) over early **T2**; cheaper and maintains unit production.

## Army Commands and Tactics
1. **Formation Movement (Ctrl+Click)**: Move selected group in formation at the speed of the slowest unit for coordinated positioning.
2. **Line Spread (Hold-Click Drag)**: Hold click and drag a line to evenly spread your army across it; ideal for cliff perching or surrounding units.
3. **Flanking Bonus**: Attack enemies or structures from multiple sides to increase total damage output of your units.
4. **Laser Damage Range**: Lasers deal only 50% damage at max range, increasing to 100% at close proximity; adjust positioning for maximum impact.
5. **Area Actions**: Set repair, attack, or reclaim to an area by clicking and dragging on the target to create a round zone of action.

## Unit and Game Details
1. **Unit Rank Benefits**: Higher-ranked units have reduced reload times and increased health; prioritize veteran units in key engagements.
2. **Terrain Traversal**:
   - **Bots**: Superior on rough, hilly terrain compared to **Vehicles**.
   - **Amphibious Vehicles**: Can handle uneven terrain effectively.
   - **Hovering Vehicles**: Immune to underwater torpedo attacks from submarines.
3. **Unit Icon Indicators**: Corners of a unit’s icon show attack capabilities (air, land, underwater); check icons for strategic deployment.

## Multiplayer and Lobby Tips
1. **Pre-Multiplayer Test**: Load one AI game first to avoid long load times or crashes in multiplayer.
2. **Finding Games**: Check multiplayer battle list or Discord for games; green = open with players, yellow = started, blue = empty or custom servers.
3. **Joining Lobbies**: Join noob-friendly lobbies (e.g., under rank 20); use queue system for in-progress games with "!notify" to get alerts when slots open.
4. **Game Customization**: Adjust spawn zones (location, number, size) when setting up a game for varied strategic starts.

## Bonus Tips
1. **Build Grid Efficiency**: Use Shift+Alt to build in boxes (e.g., **Wind Turbines**); add Space to split tasks among builders; use Z/X to spread grid and avoid chain explosions.
2. **Metal View (F7)**: Toggle metal view to see untaken **Metal Extractors**; keep radar active to light up map and track resources.
3. **Chain Explosion Awareness**: Space out structures like **Wind Turbines** (1 space via Z/X) to prevent chain reactions when destroyed.
4. **Additional Resources**: Explore BAR’s online guides and Discord community for further tips and advanced strategies.
