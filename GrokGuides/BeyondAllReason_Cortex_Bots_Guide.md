# Beyond All Reason: Cortex Bots Guide

This guide provides a quick overview of key Cortex faction bots in *Beyond All Reason*, derived from a detailed transcript analysis. While this content is integrated into the Armada Strategy Guide for cross-faction reference, it focuses specifically on Cortex units, offering insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and tactical applications. Use this guide to understand Cortex bots for potential matchups or strategic inspiration.

## Construction Bot
- **Speed**: 35 (slightly slower than Armada's equivalent, much slower than Cortex Construction Vehicles).
- **Terrain Advantage**: Less penalty on uphill terrain compared to vehicles; can traverse slopes inaccessible to vehicles (e.g., certain map areas only Bots can navigate).
- **Tactical Note**: Essential for building in rough terrain or contesting elevated positions where vehicles can't operate.

## Grave Robber
- **Role**: Similar to Armada's Lazarus; used for resource reclamation and unit resurrection.
- **Early Game Use**: Reclaim rocks/debris for extra **Metal** and foliage for **Energy**.
- **Frontline Utility**: In large numbers, repairs injured units or resurrects dead ones (consumes 1001 **Energy** per unit; faster with more Grave Robbers).
- **Reclaim vs. Resurrect**: Reclaiming provides immediate **Metal** income; resurrection requires full **Metal** restoration if partially reclaimed.
- **Tactical Note**: Balances economy boost with frontline recovery, critical for sustained engagements.

## Grunt
- **Role**: Fast infantry bot with a laser weapon (damage increases at closer range, decreases at longer range).
- **Stats Comparison**: Cheaper than Armada's Pawn but lower DPS and speed; outranges Pawn significantly (230 range vs. Pawn's shorter range).
- **Tactical Use**: Effective for kiting Pawns in early game by maintaining distance at the edge of attack range; requires micro to avoid being caught by faster Pawns.
- **Tactical Note**: Best for early skirmishes with careful positioning to exploit range advantage.

## Aggravator
- **Role**: Rocket bot for poking defenses and skirmishing stationary units.
- **Stats Comparison**: Similar cost to Armada equivalent; slightly more line of sight (+12), slower speed, and +20 health.
- **Strengths**: Outranges regular Sentry Towers (just barely, so positioning is key); effective against static defenses; can shoot over Dragon's Teeth if manually targeted.
- **Weaknesses**: Missiles don't track well, poor against moving units; vulnerable to rushes without support; doesn't outrange advanced turrets like Beamers or OverWatch.
- **Tactical Note**: Use for early defense harassment with move commands (avoid fight command to prevent over-approach); support with other units for protection.

## Thug
- **Role**: Plasma bot, similar to Armada's Mace.
- **Stats Comparison**: Slightly more expensive in **Metal** (+10), less **Energy** cost; +100 health, -1 speed compared to Mace.
- **Strengths**: Slight area-of-effect damage on impact; effective against clumped low-health units and static defenses; outranges Commander D-Gun, ideal for hunting Commanders while kiting.
- **Weaknesses**: Projectiles don't track, best against stationary targets or when kiting backwards.
- **Tactical Note**: Strong frontline unit for 360-degree firing while retreating; excels at Commander harassment due to speed and range advantage.

## Thrasher
- **Role**: Anti-air bot, similar to Armada's Crossbow.
- **Stats Comparison**: Slightly slower, better line of sight, more HP than Crossbow.
- **Strengths**: Effective early game against T1 Flyers and Scouts; amphibious, can walk underwater for surprise sea attacks (can't shoot while submerged).
- **Weaknesses**: Damage falls off against T2 air units; not the strongest anti-air option overall.
- **Tactical Note**: Use early for air defense or mix with units like Salamanders for amphibious strategies; deploy against known air scout threats.

## Conclusion
Understanding Cortex Bots provides valuable insight for Armada players facing Cortex opponents or seeking strategic parallels. These units emphasize terrain adaptability (Construction Bot), resource recovery (Grave Robber), and specialized combat roles (Grunt, Aggravator, Thug, Thrasher), offering a contrast to Armada's balanced approach. Use this guide to anticipate Cortex tactics or adapt similar strategies within Armada's framework.
