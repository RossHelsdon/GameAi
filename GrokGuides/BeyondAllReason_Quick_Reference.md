# Beyond All Reason: Frontline Quick Reference Guide

This guide provides a concise, ordered list of strategies and build orders for frontline players in **Beyond All Reason**. Use this as a quick reference to execute effective gameplay based on detailed analysis of high-skill frontline play.

## Early Game Build Order
1. **Metal Extractors (Maxes)**: Queue up 3 **Metal Extractors** to secure initial metal income on key deposits.
2. **Energy Setup**:
   - High wind: Build 3 **Wind Turbines** (Winans) for energy.
   - Low wind: Build **Solar Collectors** (Solas) to conserve energy, as they cost only metal.
3. **Bot Lab**: Construct a **Bot Lab** for early unit production (reclaim later for a **Vehicle Lab** closer to the frontline).
4. **Construction Units**: Build 3 **Construction Bots** to support structure development.
5. **Scout Units**: Produce 2-3 **Ticks** or **Fleas** for map scouting; react to enemy scouts by queuing 10 **Fleas**.
6. **Commander Push**: Move your **Commander** to the map's middle by ~4:30 minutes to claim territory, focusing on forward progress over stopping at every deposit.

## Core Strategies (Ordered by Priority)
1. **Defensive Line Setup**:
   - Place **Light Laser Turrets (LLTs)** at chokepoints or trenches; shield with **Commander** to protect from **D-Gun** (note: D-Gun no longer affects Commanders).
   - Build **Construction Turrets** near base, placing **Wind Turbines** within their radius for build speed boost.
   - Deploy a frontline **Radar** for enemy backline visibility and flanking opportunities.
2. **Lane Defense**:
   - Protect your assigned lane (especially on map edges) to prevent enemy run-bys; avoid overextension to prevent 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios.
   - Use scout intel from **Fleas** or **Radar** to seal gaps in your line and identify enemy flank routes.
3. **Unit Progression**:
   - Start with **Pawns** (or **Grunts**) for early defense and skirmishing.
   - Transition to **Thugs** by mid-T1 for stronger pushes (effective vs. basic units, less range than **Roccos**).
   - Use **Roccos** (Rockets) to counter T1 static defenses like **Sentries**.
   - Shift to **Vehicles** for T1.5 mobility with **Stouts** (counter fast units like **Hounds**) and **Light Artillery** (outranges most T1 defenses, except **The Gauntlet**).
4. **Resource Management**:
   - Reclaim metal with **Lazarus** units from destroyed frontline assets (e.g., 135 metal per reclaim).
   - Upgrade **Metal Extractors** to **Advanced Metal Extractors (Amaxes)** for increased metal income.
   - Delay **Aphis** (Advanced Energy Converters) until 3-4 **Fusion Reactors** are built; prioritize unit production over early heavy eco investment.

## Advanced Build Order and Tactics
1. **Mid-Game Defense Layers**:
   - T1: **Light Laser Turrets (LLTs)** or **Sentries** (weak vs. **Thugs**).
   - T1.5: **Wardens** (counter **Thugs**).
   - Mid-Game: **Pit Bulls** (strong static defense with range for passes).
   - T2: **Rattlesnakes** (cloakable pop-up plasma artillery, long range for disruption).
2. **Late-Game Defense and Push**:
   - Build **Pulsars** (long-range plasma cannons); use "Pulsar creep" by advancing slowly with unit support.
   - Deploy **Annihilators/Take-Ons** for high-damage static defense.
   - Place **Obelisks** on map edges for anti-air defense against **Bombers** or **Valiants**.
3. **Tier 2 and 3 Units**:
   - Request or build **T2 Bots** like **Gunslingers** (formerly Mavericks) for frontline strength.
   - Use **Hounds** (Fidos) for mobility and countering enemy breakthroughs.
   - Scale to **T3** with **Thor** (EMP capability) or **Battle Mech**, supported by multiple **Butlers** for fast construction.
4. **Special Tactics**:
   - Deploy **EMP Missile Launchers** to disable enemy units for counterattacks or defense.
   - Communicate with allies (e.g., ping "help 3v1") when overwhelmed; buying time for backline scaling is critical.
   - Support adjacent lanes with **Stouts** or **Hounds** if teammates falter.

## Quick Tips
- Balance defense (**LLTs**, **Rattlesnakes**) with aggression (**Hounds** for harassment).
- Adapt unit choices to enemy composition (**Stouts** vs. fast units, **Roccos** vs. static defense).
- Reclaim and upgrade constantly to sustain frontline losses.
- Prepare for air threats with early **Obelisks** on map edges.
