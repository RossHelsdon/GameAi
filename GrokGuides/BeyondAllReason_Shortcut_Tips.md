# Beyond All Reason: Shortcut Tips for Base Management

Welcome, commanders, to a focused guide on improving your base management in **Beyond All Reason**. This markdown, derived from a detailed transcript, compiles small tricks, shortcuts, and smart habits to save time, resources, and frustration. Whether you're managing build queues or spacing structures, these tips will enhance your efficiency. If anything is unclear, feel free to seek clarification through community channels. Note that this guide assumes the grid layout for hotkeys; if your layout differs, some key bindings may not match.

## Command Queue Management

1. **Front of Queue Insertion**: Hold **Space** while issuing a new command to place it at the front of a builder's queue. Useful when a builder has multiple tasks (e.g., 10 queued actions) and an urgent task arises.
2. **Smart Queue Insertion**: Hold **Shift + Space** to add a new task to the queue, sorting it based on walking distances. This fits the task naturally along the builder's path.
3. **Skip Current Command**: Press **N** to skip the current command and move to the next in the queue. Handy if a builder is stuck or a more urgent task needs priority.
4. **Remove Last Command**: Press **Ctrl + N** to remove the last command in the queue, streamlining task lists.
5. **Cancel Mid-Queue Building**: Place a new building on top of a queued one to cancel it mid-queue, avoiding unnecessary construction.

## Factory Build Precision

1. **Front of Build Order**: Hold **Alt** while adding a unit to a factory queue to place it at the front. Behavior varies with repeat option:
   - **Repeat On**: Current unit finishes, then the added unit is built.
   - **Repeat Off**: Current unit is canceled, and the added unit starts immediately.
2. **Quota Mode**: Enable quota mode in factories to maintain a specific number of units on the map (e.g., set 5 **Respawn Bots**; factory builds until 5 are active, resumes if one dies). Quotas work alongside regular build queues without canceling them.
3. **Quota Per Factory**: Each factory has its own quota count (e.g., setting 5 **Respawn Bots** in 2 factories results in 10 total bots on the map).
4. **Build Order Priority**: Factories prioritize builds as follows: units added with **Alt**, then quota units, and finally regular queue units.

## Constructor Efficiency

1. **Auto-Split Across Buildings**: Select multiple **Constructors**, queue several buildings with **Shift**, and release the mouse while holding **Space**. Each **Constructor** picks a different building, avoiding sequential walking delays. Ideal for multiple projects where travel time exceeds build time.
2. **Looping Area Repair**: After queuing buildings (e.g., 10 **Converters** near a **Fusion**), select **Constructor Turrets** and hold **Alt** while dragging a repair circle over the build area. This sets a looping repair task, keeping turrets assigned to that zone for ongoing builds or repairs, preventing automatic return to previous tasks like assisting a **Fusion**.

## Building Placement and Spacing

1. **Automatic Spacing**: Press **Alt + Z** or **Alt + X** to space out buildings automatically while placing them (e.g., hold **Shift** to draft a line, then add **Alt + Z/X** to adjust gaps). Spacing prevents:
   - Chain reactions (especially near **Fusions** or energy structures).
   - Splash damage from enemy attacks.
   - Spacing settings are saved per building type and persist between matches.
2. **Blast Radius Check**: Hold **Space + X** while placing a building to see its explosion radius. Critical for risky structures like **Energy Converters** (fragile, high damage) and **Fusions** (sturdier, massive explosion). Avoid placing **Converters** near **Fusions** to prevent catastrophic chain reactions.
3. **Structure Placement Rule**: Spread out **Construction Turrets** and energy structures to minimize chain reaction risks. A single air strike or raid can wipe out an economy if structures are too close.

## Reclaiming Efficiency

1. **Full Metal Recovery**: Reclaim obsolete structures for 100% metal return. Essential for funding higher tech levels; don't leave old structures or wrecks unused.
2. **Area Reclaim Shortcut**: Hold **Alt** and drag when issuing a reclaim order to target only similar objects. Start drag on a specific type (e.g., **Wind Turbine**) to reclaim only that type in the area, avoiding accidental reclamation of important structures. Works for map resources like trees as well.

## Key Takeaways for Base Management

- **Queue Control**: Use **Space** and **Shift + Space** to prioritize urgent tasks in builder queues; **N** and **Ctrl + N** to skip or remove unnecessary commands.
- **Factory Precision**: Leverage **Alt** for urgent unit builds and quota mode to maintain desired unit counts without micromanagement.
- **Constructor Optimization**: Split tasks with **Space** during multi-builds and use **Alt + Drag** for looping repair zones to keep **Constructors** focused on active build areas.
- **Spacing Safety**: Apply **Alt + Z/X** for automatic spacing and check blast radii with **Space + X** to prevent chain explosions, especially with **Converters** and **Fusions**.
- **Reclaim Smart**: Use **Alt + Drag** for selective area reclaim to efficiently recover metal for tech progression.

## Conclusion

These shortcuts and habits, while small individually, combine to significantly boost your base management efficiency in **Beyond All Reason**. By mastering queue control, factory precision, constructor optimization, safe spacing, and smart reclaiming, you'll free up time to focus on army micro or strategic decisions. Practice these techniques to streamline your gameplay and build a stronger foundation for victory.
