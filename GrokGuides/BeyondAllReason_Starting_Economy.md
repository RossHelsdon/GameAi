# Beyond All Reason: Starting Economy Guide

This guide provides a focused, list-based tutorial for new players of **Beyond All Reason** on establishing a strong starting economy. Based on detailed transcripts, it covers faction selection, initial setup, resource management, and early build orders to help beginners balance metal and energy income while transitioning to unit production. Use this reference to master the foundational steps of gameplay.

## Pre-Game Setup
1. **Practice Environment**: Start a skirmish vs. AI game (use **Barbarian AI** for realistic difficulty) to practice economy setup without multiplayer pressure.
2. **Faction Choice**: Select **Armada** as a beginner-friendly faction (fully developed compared to **Cortex** or work-in-progress **Legion**).
3. **Commander Importance**: Recognize the **Commander** as your primary builder and strongest early damage unit; losing it ends a 1v1 match or contributes to team loss in multiplayer.
4. **Starting Position**: Choose a teleport spot for your **Commander** with 3-4 closely packed **Metal Deposits** (white circles on map); prioritize quick selection in multiplayer.
5. **Pre-Match Planning**: Hold Shift and left-click to queue buildings before the match starts; place within **Commander** build range (green circle) to avoid movement delays; correct errors by overwriting queued buildings.

## Interface Settings for Economy Management
1. **Enable Cost Visibility**: In Options > Interface (Advanced Settings), toggle "Always Show Prices" to see **Metal** (white) and **Energy** (yellow) costs for buildings.
2. **Additional UI Tools**: Enable "Unit Groups", "Idle Builders", "Factory Dock", and "Energy Converter Usage" for better resource and production tracking.
3. **Building Grid**: Activate "Building Grid" option (Interface, Page 2) for easier building placement.
4. **Team Colors**: In Accessibility tab, enable "Simple Team Colors Icon" for clear player identification (adjust to shades with experience).

## Starting Economy Build Order
1. **Initial Resources**: Begin with 1000 **Metal** and 1000 **Energy**; prioritize extraction/production to avoid quick depletion.
2. **Metal Extractors First**: Queue 2 **Metal Extractors** (or 3 if close together) for **Commander** to build; each costs 500 **Energy**, so balance with energy needs. Ensure one **Metal Extractor** per deposit for optimal resource gathering.
3. **Energy Production (Wind-Dependent)**:
   - High Wind Maps: Add 3 **Wind Turbines** (check wind strength via map info card: top number = min speed, bottom = max speed, hover over wind icon for average power to confirm viability); output varies with wind.
   - Low/No Wind Maps: Build **Solar Collectors** (constant energy output); viable with 3 **Metal Extractors** since they don't require energy to build.
   - Adapt to Wind Drops: If wind speed falls, hold Spacebar and left-click to prioritize a **Solar Collector** ahead of queued buildings.
4. **Further Metal Expansion**: Queue additional **Metal Extractors** after energy setup, targeting richer spots (higher numbers in white circles) for outer territory and defense points.
5. **Note on Variability**: No universal build order exists due to map-specific wind and metal conditions; adapt plans dynamically each match.

## Understanding Streaming Economy
1. **Resource Drain Mechanics**: Resources are spent continuously from stockpiles (not in batches); monitor bars at screen top for real-time status.
2. **Resource Bar Breakdown**:
   - Bottom Green: Income per second.
   - Top Bright Red: Total spend (active production + stockpile drain).
   - Other Red: Spend from active production only (bright red > other red = stockpile drain).
   - Middle: Current stockpile amount.
   - Right: Maximum stockpile capacity.
3. **Energy Converter Option**: Excess **Energy** can convert to **Metal** via **Energy Converters** (late-game focus, 70 **Energy** = 1 **Metal** at T1); adjust white box on energy bar (visible with "Energy Converter Usage" enabled) to control conversion rateâ€”move right for surplus, left if production drops.

## Transition to Unit Production
1. **First Production Facility**: Build a **Bot Lab** (simpler for beginners over **Vehicle Lab**) for early unit production.
2. **Queue Units Early**: Select **Bot Lab** (even pre-construction) to queue units:
   - 1 **Constructor Bot** (extra build options).
   - 5 **Ticks** (fast scout bots, wide sight, hold Shift to queue multiple).
   - 3 more **Constructor Bots**.
   - 10 **Pawns** (infantry bots, higher firepower/HP, hold Shift for bulk order).
3. **Boost Build Speed**: Select **Commander**, right-click **Bot Lab** to add its build power (high energy cost; build more energy production if stockpile drains).
4. **Factory Dock Monitoring**: Use enabled "Factory Dock" UI (right side) to track and queue unit production without returning to base.

## Advanced Build Techniques
1. **Energy Production Lines**: Hold Shift to drag a line of **Wind Turbines**; add Alt for double/triple lines; add Z for gaps to prevent chain explosions on destruction.
2. **Auto Unit Groups**: Use Alt + Number to form persistent unit groups (new units of same type auto-join); applies across matches.
3. **Construction Turret**: Use a **Constructor Bot** to build a **Construction Turret** (adds 200 build power to nearby projects); can't start builds but can finish them independently.
4. **Constructor Auto-Assist**: New **Constructor Bots** auto-add build power to their origin lab until reassigned.
5. **Queue Insertion**: Hold Spacebar when adding a new action to insert it at the front of the build queue without canceling existing orders.
6. **Explosion Radius Awareness**: Check explosion radius of buildings/units by selecting them and holding Space + X (shows red rings for death, glowing for self-destruct); space out structures to avoid chain reactions.
7. **Reclaim for Tier 2**: Reclaim less efficient T1 structures like basic **Solar Collectors** or **Energy-to-Metal Converters** when reaching T2 to recover significant metal for advanced builds.

## Key Takeaways for Starting Economy
1. **Adapt to Map Conditions**: Tailor builds to wind strength and metal spot values; prioritize **Metal Extractors** (one per deposit) and balance with **Wind Turbines** or **Solar Collectors** after checking wind viability.
2. **Protect Resources**: Early economy setup is critical; losing **Commander** or failing to expand risks resource starvation.
3. **Monitor Streaming Economy**: Watch resource bars to avoid stockpile drain; adjust builds or converter usage as needed.
4. **Transition Efficiently**: Move from economy to unit production with **Bot Lab** and queued units like **Ticks** and **Pawns** for scouting and defense.

This guide focuses on the critical first steps of establishing an economy in **Beyond All Reason**. Practice these techniques against AI before multiplayer, and refer to other guides in the series for deeper gameplay mechanics and strategies. Build a strong foundation and progress to dominate the battlefield!
