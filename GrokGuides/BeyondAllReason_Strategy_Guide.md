# Beyond All Reason: Frontline Strategy Guide for New Players

Welcome, new commanders, to **Beyond All Reason**, a real-time strategy game where positioning, resource management, and tactical decisions shape the battlefield. This guide focuses on the **Frontline** role, a critical position tasked with defending your team's backline while harassing the enemy. Drawing from an in-depth analysis of a high-skill player's gameplay, this report provides actionable strategies to help you excel as a frontline player. Whether you're holding a key lane or pushing into enemy territory, these tips will set you on the path to victory.

## Understanding the Frontline Role

As a frontline player, your primary objectives are twofold:
- **Defend Your Backline**: Protect your team's economy-focused players (backliners) so they can scale up to advanced units and structures like **T2** and **Fusion Reactors**.
- **Harass the Enemy Backline**: Disrupt the enemy's economy and force them to divert resources to defense, slowing their progression.

Frontline positions, especially on the map's edges, are more vulnerable since you often lack immediate support from teammates. Mistakes here can lead to enemy breakthroughs, so caution and awareness are paramount.

## Starting Strong: Early Game Setup

### 1. Resource Opening
- **Metal Extractors (Maxes)**: Begin by queuing up multiple **Metal Extractors** to secure early metal income. Aim to place them on key deposits as you expand.
- **Energy Choice Based on Wind**: If wind levels are high, opt for **Wind Turbines** (also called Winans) for energy. If wind is low, switch to **Solar Collectors** (Solas) since they cost only metal, preserving energy for other builds.
- **Commander Movement**: Move your **Commander** to the middle of the map quickly (target around 4:30 minutes) to claim territory and metal deposits. Avoid stopping at every deposit—focus on forward momentum.

### 2. Initial Builds
- **Bot Lab Opening**: Start with a **Bot Lab** for early unit production. Many frontliners reclaim this later to build a **Vehicle Lab** closer to the frontline for faster unit deployment.
- **Construction Units**: Queue up **Construction Bots** (aim for 3 initially) to build structures. If energy stalls, build additional **Solar Collectors** to balance resources.
- **Early Units**: Produce scout units like **Ticks** or **Fleas** (2-3 initially) to explore the map and spot enemy movements. React quickly to enemy scouts by deploying your own **Fleas** (e.g., queue 10 if you spot enemy units).

## Core Frontline Strategies

### 1. Establishing a Defensive Line
- **Light Laser Turrets (LLTs)**: Place **Light Laser Turrets** at key chokepoints or trenches to control territory. Position your **Commander** in front of these turrets to shield them from enemy **D-Gun** attacks (note: recent updates mean D-Gun no longer affects Commanders, enhancing this tactic).
- **Construction Turrets**: Build **Construction Turrets** near your base to boost build speed. Place **Wind Turbines** within their radius for efficient energy production.
- **Radar Placement**: Deploy a **Radar** on the frontline to gain visibility into enemy backline movements, enabling potential flanking opportunities.

### 2. Unit Composition and Progression
- **Early Infantry**: Use **Pawns** (or **Grunts** for the opposing faction) as your default early-game infantry for basic defense and skirmishing.
- **Mid-Tier Bots**: Transition to **Thugs** (formerly Thuds) by mid-T1 for stronger pushing power. They have lower range than some units like **Roccos** but excel in durability. **Roccos** (or Rockets) are effective against T1 static defenses like **Sentries**.
- **Vehicle Transition**: Shift to **Vehicles** for T1.5 options like **Stouts**, which are mobile and effective against fast units like **Hounds** (or Fidos). **Light Artillery** outranges most T1 static defenses (except **The Gauntlet**), making it a key asset for sieging.
- **Tier 2 Units**: Request **T2 Bots** (e.g., **Gunslingers**, formerly Mavericks) from allies or build them yourself to bolster your frontline. **Hounds** remain crucial for mobility and countering enemy breakthroughs.

### 3. Map Control and Lanes
- **Lane Awareness**: Understand your "lane" or area of responsibility on the map (similar to MOBAs like League of Legends). Protect your lane to prevent enemy run-bys, especially on map edges where support is limited.
- **Avoid Overextension**: Pushing too far can lead to 1v2 or 1v3 situations, weakening your position. Balance aggression with defense to maintain map control without overextending.
- **Flanking Maneuvers**: Use scout intel from **Radar** or units like **Fleas** to identify gaps for flanking. Seal these gaps in your own line to prevent enemy infiltration.

### 4. Reclaiming and Resource Management
- **Reclaim Metal**: Use units like **Lazarus** to reclaim metal from destroyed units or structures on the frontline. This boosts your economy significantly (e.g., reclaiming 135 metal in one go as seen in the gameplay).
- **Incremental Economy**: Avoid building expensive structures like **Aphis** (Advanced Energy Converters) until you have 3-4 **Fusion Reactors**. Focus on unit production over heavy economic investments early on.
- **Upgrade Extractors**: Convert **Metal Extractors** to **Advanced Metal Extractors (Amaxes)** as soon as possible to increase metal income, especially on the frontline where losses are frequent.

## Advanced Frontline Tactics

### 1. Static Defense Layers
- Build a layered defense with escalating static structures:
  - **Light Laser Turrets (LLTs)** or **Sentries**: Early T1 defense, effective against basic units but weaker against **Thugs**.
  - **Wardens**: Mid-tier defense to counter **Thugs**.
  - **Pit Bulls**: Strong mid-game static defense with decent range to cover passes.
  - **Rattlesnakes**: Cloakable pop-up plasma artillery with extensive range, ideal for disrupting enemy formations.
  - **Pulsars**: Long-range plasma cannons for late-game defense. Use "Pulsar creep" by slowly advancing them with unit support to push forward.
  - **Annihilators/Take-Ons**: High-damage static defense, difficult to counter without advanced units or tactics.
- Counter enemy static defense with appropriate units (e.g., **Light Artillery** beats most T1 defenses, but loses to **Rattlesnakes** or **Pulsars**).

### 2. Communication and Teamplay
- **Request Help**: If facing a 3v1 or similar disadvantage, communicate with allies (e.g., ping "help 3v1"). Buying time for your backline to scale is a victory in itself, even if you lose ground.
- **Support Allies**: Cover adjacent lanes if a teammate's **Commander** falls or if gaps appear. Use units like **Stouts** or **Hounds** to intercept enemy breakthroughs.
- **Share Resources**: Send metal to allies for **T2 Bots** or other critical units if your economy allows.

### 3. Late-Game Scaling and Defense
- **Fusion Reactors**: Build multiple **Fusion Reactors** (3-4) before transitioning to **Aphis** for energy. Fusions are more cost-effective early (4300 metal for 1000 energy vs. 9700 metal for Aphis).
- **Anti-Air Defense**: Place **Obelisks** along map edges to counter bombing runs, a common tactic against frontline bases. These have significant range and can shred aircraft like **Bombers** or **Valiants**.
- **T3 Units**: Scale into **T3** units like **Thor** (with EMP capabilities) or **Battle Mech** for late-game pushes. Support with numerous **Butlers** (advanced construction units) to speed up builds.
- **EMP Tactics**: Use **EMP Missile Launchers** to disable enemy units temporarily, creating windows for counterattacks or defense.

## Key Takeaways for New Frontliners

- **Balance Defense and Aggression**: Your role is to protect your backline while disrupting the enemy. Prioritize defensive structures like **LLTs** and **Rattlesnakes** while using mobile units like **Hounds** for harassment.
- **Adapt to Threats**: Transition unit types based on enemy composition (e.g., **Stouts** vs. **Hounds**, **Roccos** vs. static defense).
- **Communicate**: Always inform allies of enemy pushes or if you're overwhelmed. Buying time for your backline to reach **T2** or **Fusion** can turn the game.
- **Reclaim and Upgrade**: Constantly reclaim metal with **Lazarus** and upgrade to **Amaxes** to sustain your economy under pressure.
- **Prepare for Air**: Edge positions are vulnerable to air raids. Build **Obelisks** early to prevent devastating **Bomber** runs.
