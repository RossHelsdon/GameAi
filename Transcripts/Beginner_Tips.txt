I get it beyond all reason is not the easiest game to get into not even the easiest RTS to get into again it's a genre notorious for elitism and complexity maybe not necessarily in that order but you know one usually ends up with the other but it really is a little simpler than you think and also more complicated but not in ways we're going to describe today I am going to talk about some of the uh the basic things that I've learned sometimes difficult things to learn over the last month or so of playing the game that I wish I would have learned on on the first day so and a lot of these tips came from you the people so like
subscribe if you do enjoy if you learn something or if you think I missed something of course leave a comment that's where I got some of these from but we're gonna go over five basic categories we'll probably put a bonus one at the end because that's what good YouTubers do but the first thing first is uh settings there's a few of them um the first very first thing before everything else I'm going to be doing grid hotkeys grid optimized hotkeys I want to let you in on a secret not not a well-kept secret but if you go to controls grid optimized hotkeys that'll set you there you can also customize your hotkeys by not going to get in to all of that that's a little more complicated you can find more info on the Discord but you can find a list of the keys here this is by default and then um obviously there's a lot here so instead of trying to Pilot the space shuttle or at least play Microsoft flight simulator I'm going to go over the basics but from here on out I'm going to be assuming you're using grid Keys which doesn't affect too much for basic commands but it does affect some of the specifics I've got the virtual keyboard on the screen over to the side so grid hotkeys under control some other game settings many of these are are uh preference but some I think are pretty much necessary or at least highly recommended for a new player um set Target as default so that allows you to right click to essentially be a focused Target many units can attack while moving and this will mean if they get in range they will prioritize that Target whether it's enemy command or something like that um otherwise they they might end up attacking ground which is the phone which is not always ideal as much as I hate the ground as well um when it comes to the interface working with that grid we have uh this is how you get let me let me select a commander here or or any Builder this is how you get this menu uh the way it's set up beware some menus have a couple pages um but this is how you get the grid set up which you can use for building all these things I find that to be a lot more convenient coming from Starcraft I think it it's highly recommended um and it works with those great hotkeys in a way that doesn't overlap because if you're sitting with uh normal hotkeys they will somewhat overlap with some of the grid boot keys same thing always show prices uh group icon radar icon you can see uh let you in on the information so that way you know what you're looking at I think a very important for new players and another thing over here the player list so a lot of players wonder how do I see my rank my open skill score I'm not going to get too much into detail but just know much like Starcraft 2. you have a number for your to use for balancing in lobbies um and a rank icon the rank icon is kind of like leagues in Starcraft 2 you get a fancier rank icon the higher up you go with your your number but the number is what's used for balancing and all that you can see how good or bad and as you play more games it gets more confident you can find more info on the Discord anyways I'd like to have pretty much all this info on but of course the most important is the mascot choose your own over here um I won't judge you I might a little depending on which one you pick but uh don't forget to enable that of course and one more thing is icons um icon scale and distance everything else I think in many ways is a preference as is icon scale and distance but I think this is worth pointing out because a lot of people have mixed feelings about the icons I personally like having the icons there's a guide on the website as to what they all mean but it makes a lot easier especially I find to pick out Constructors and such on the field um when you're looking at them so but just know this option exists and that's how you switch that up also uh there make sure you look through all the widgets and stuff like that some of them are built in some of them um are are things you can update on the website but I think that covers most of our basic settings the grid Keys uh the player list stuff you can enable DPS counts and and defense ranges but these are all um user preference I'd mess around with them a bit so all right now that we've finally made it out of the menus what's next hotkeys and commands of which there are well you know several first things first almost every command in the game pretty much every command in the game not only can be issued to a certain area but it can be issued to an actual area the most useful and basic one of this is metal extractors you can either use Ctrl Z or just double tap the command you'll see that little icon and now your whatever it is in this case the Twitter combat engineer one of my favorite units
I'm a twitcher myself uh most days make sure to check out the Stream uh we'll go around and shift Q through ideally close to where you started but there are other uses for this um whether it's repairing in a certain area attacking of course there are no targets it will prioritize you can do like a drag select to prioritize maybe a certain amount of targets but there's a whole lot of uses and almost everything can be can be dragged out like that a big one is actually reclaimed um reclaim is something that becomes one of the most relevant parts of the game both for from the map many maps have the ability to reclaim natural resources which is a big part of early game builds or reclaiming either your own units and buildings which is a big part of getting metal or even more relevant wrecks on the ground fun fact the reason why a lot of players will self-destruct their commander in team games is because it's worth 2 000 metal and that's also why it's very important not to lose your commander where your opponents can reclaim it as of course um that is a a huge amount of metal to lose in the early game so reclaim is a big part of supplementing your income and controlling fights alongside that big area Drake it should be by default on your screen you can find exactly how much and in what area and this brings us to the repeat command the repeat command Works side by side with reclaim and movement you can repeat now many of you probably already won you can repeat the build um T by default is the key say you want to build I don't know some some grunts that's a common one just repeat it'll build a grunt and then just keep doing that command that's simple enough also we're just going to jam this in here what if I want say a Constructor I'm going to hold the ALT key just build one Constructor it'll put it next in the queue but it won't add it to the repeat command so you can just use that to smash a unit in the queue a lot of the times Constructors are the main version just keep them going there uh and of course you don't have to you can essentially issue any command and also very key let's say let's build something larger here you can issue commands to a unit as it's building as well so say I wanted to start an advanced Fusion reactor pretty optimistic but I could do that and you can shift cue it speaking of shift Q as well that works with the repeat command so you want to move you're getting hit by artillery say uh for some reason this guy is uh any moment now please firing on this set well you want to move out of that artillery so we're going to add the repeat command and then do hold two shift clicks as you see here got the AI over there just to make things more interesting so now they can just repeat between all of them you also got the patrol command which is by h on grid um but another fun use uh this is a little Advanced but just to show you how many options there are with the repeat command we're gonna set these guys on repair is the combat engineer can build themed assault Bots which are pretty popular I'm going to set it on repeat and even if you don't have a bot lab well guess what you do got a Twitter so the repeat command has a lot of uses don't be afraid to try it out it's one of the most useful things that you might not be um uh used to I just used a stop command to stop everyone there so say you want to select of a certain type all those Mammoth tanks the q key is select all of type uh if you want to oh but or maybe all your grunts well that's a lot of grunts do I want all those grunts there well the control q key splits it in half maybe some more split in half again aircraft spotted want to build antier well I can't do that out there but uh Q is select all on the on the screen and then control Q splits those units off in a different group so you wanted to send few units over here I do this a lot and now suddenly you've already or even behind the lines now if you select them you see they've already got those commands issued there's also the fight command um which is useful for especially like artillery and all that the fight command is much like attack move in Starcraft the fight command will stop you once you're in range to attack as opposed to the move command which you will still fire while moving but uh important to note the difference usually with uh Frontline units you want to use move move commands and back line units like artillery fight commands are more popular so the fight command can't be dragged in area um I usually just have to drag it out like that it doesn't matter which way it's facing they'll turn around maybe it matters for vehicles anyway um drawing in pings all right this is a favorite one surprisingly little abused because of course people will start ignoring you but if you hold it's tilde and then Q for default you can draw on the map any point any time if you want to delete it dildo right click say but you want to be more specific middle click tilde plus middle click and then if you just don't drag if you hold tilde you quick double click there you go we're just going through all these we're going to go into a little bit more of Team stuff that's up next but um so there's your basic pings all of that I'm complaining to your team one more thing is cameras and camera options I've seen a few people get stuck here but they're different camera modes the overhead cam is default and then the spring cam there's also camera hotkeys which we're not going to get into but the spring cam gives you a little bit more flexibility in the fact so in order to rotate the camera up and down I'm holding control and moving the scroll wheel up and down without control just zoom in and out Ctrl T map overview maybe Jimmy will put these on the screen if we do any editing I doubt it we get a thousand likes on this video maybe we'll edit one probably not because that means people like it as it is either way what was I saying oh yeah control scroll brings you up and down scroll wheel just straight up and down uh alt up and down is just like 10 times multiplier so you want to go quickly Ctrl t for take a look at all that um or just you know that's the hockey but if you're on the spring cam and uh you got to be a little careful I still struggle with it most people accidentally activate this one but you can actually rotate the camera which is nice for screenshots and all that speaking of control F7 is your hotkey for um getting rid of the UI but oh my God what has happened to my camera Well Control F5 will bring you back and I believe it is um by default it's control F2 we'll do that for you so you got your repeat command you got your dragon everything you got uh the ability to um ping oh yeah idle Constructors control tap we'll select usually the nearest idle Constructor it's not always perfect also if you enable it you got your idle Constructors down here um so you can use that to determine what you want to build also just the Tab Key in general will select your commander so I've gotten out of the hot habit of hot King my commander now there's uh because I have the Tab Key okay one last thing I wasn't sure if I was going to cover it in this but I think we should cover it auto groups Auto groups can be enabled and if you hold it's much like control groups if you hold the ALT key plus a number you've got an auto group um and what that means is all units of that name will automatically be added to that control group you notice my grunts are on one say I wanted them on Auto Group zero or seven now beautifully for many of you especially if you're maybe a little lower APM um you can uh these persist between games so migrants will be in the next game I play if I choose to they'll be on one uh I like to have my artillery on two so on and so forth and that's why you see I already have control groups down there without seemingly touching anything if you want to remove something control tilde is the key so that that one to the left of one all right we're gonna get some of those uh anti-air box here anyway hey guys getting a little frisky so Auto groups are something worth toying with you got to be careful not to rely too much on them you can always just so the game will automatically select only military units it won't select your Constructors unless you hold shift so um you can just select from there something to point out all right so I do want to point out uh Team games team games I think we should actually jump into the team so you can easily jump into versus AI Lobby uh I'm gonna go ahead jump in here add a couple so that way we get the team game UI but I'm gonna go over just a few of the basics for team games one how to not make your team hate you we already went over pings and such which are obviously mostly for team games so you can kind of use them to Mark out places on the map if you'd like um as well they're not entirely useless in in early game for that but um so while we're loading the team play section also I want to point out something sometimes before you jump into multiplayer I recommend loading one game against the AI as a lot of the time um players will struggle like you'll have a very long load or might even end up crashing I'm not some people have that issue uh so I recommend playing one game not even necessarily playing just loading one game against the AI before you play multiplayer but anyways so team games choose your starting location now this map is usually useful for starting location I was getting to that but uh it's getting to 8v8 now notice whatever faction uh you pick in the load screen is kind of irrelevant you can switch it right here in the start so starting locations and most Maps consist of having at least three metal extractors nearby um so here you'd have sometimes higher level players will do this they'll map it out or just ping them for you but some maps will have a more backline location which is used to be a little greedier but usually you want to focus on getting units out there so let's say I picked this there you go um I like I like picking around the edges usually you can really focus on on breaking through anyways uh so once you pick your starting location you can set up your build beforehand and I did miss one thing that I want to go over as well on hotkeys but we'll just we'll just start the game real quick I'm not gonna be playing it out what I wanted to do was talk about the um uh how to transfer resources and how that works in team games so all of the resources that you get go up here into your if you have storage you have more energy production facilities and Constructors both give you a little bit of storage but um the obvious you don't want to build too much storage early even for energy but maybe one or two energy storage metal storage later on but anyways um so in order to transfer resources to your entire team you can just drag the slider down and that will if your team isn't full and in this case you can actually see that my AI teammate named human uh is full of metal so I can't actually transfer it but if I wanted to manually do it up to however much they have in storage and this is a lot of the time will happen with I don't know helping someone get or if you have extra or just in general if you want to do it all you have to do drag this slider on whichever teammate you can scale up the UI oh yeah and if you double tap it you can bake as well on yours um I need unit support so what's this icon this is double click to share units this is one of the most relevant ones in a very small scale of Team games so you can transfer you don't get them back by the way unless they send a Mac or you can transfer whatever you're currently selecting I've seen people accidentally transfer your commander be careful um whatever you're selecting uh to your teammates now this is mostly used for tier two Constructors tier two Constructors which give you access to tier 2 metal extractors which are four times as good as tier one now another I'm just gonna sit this is a side note not really a quick tip but tier two is incredibly expensive in order to get I'm going to enable cheats here so I can just get up the tech tree but going tier two too quickly is the easiest way to to well one um and you can you can put these in all your AI games these these commands as well no cost build a Constructor still takes a moment um but it is 2 900 metal so most of the time in order to rush tier two players will self-destruct their own Commander and um they will reclaim it in order to gain that much metal another time usually if you're not doing a quick Tech build then you usually won't be looking for tier two uh units not necessarily your Constructor until like 10 minutes ideally you have maybe a reclaimed field that wasn't the tier two but there it is no cost means instant build as well but uh make sure as long as you can consistently produce units and your opponents don't have tier two if you're at least at the halfway mark uh you probably want to focus on just building tier one or maybe even adding in if you opened up Bots vehicles with like artillery tanks or if you opened up Vehicles adding in some Bots in order to fill things in because building another tier one production facility is a very much cheaper than going tier two so just keep that in mind there is no hard and fast rule for going tier two unless you're doing a tech build which I would not recommend for new players but I just want to point that out so you've got your begging which I wouldn't do too much of unless you really need it um you've got your unit transfer your resource transfer and here's your bonus tip uh your build grid people know about shift quick buildings but shift build shift alt allows you to build boxes very much used especially for things like wind turbines now if you build things too close together they can sometimes chain react and explode the same is true very much true with wind turbines if you have three close together well let me let me get actually build a little camera in there so if you have too many wind turbines close together all right we're going to get even more complicated if you hold shift alt in space they will divide the tasks up between each other throw a few Fighters oh my God and and each build in the most well at least they'll split the task which is a lot more relevant with the ground Constructors as opposed to air Constructors are less powerful though they can fly they're more expensive as well so they're they're used for those hard to reach places and for later on when walking around it's difficult but let's see I'm going to self-destruct control B okay bad example it has to hit one of the center ones but a lot of buildings do damage when they explode okay these are all bad examples Jimmy we didn't test this beforehand maybe you have to kill two I don't know I know I'm right but I'm not sure there you go if two of them die well that's what happens please stop all right but in order to spread out the grid you can just simply hit Z did you add space or X so one space between wind turbines is usually enough to prevent that sort of chain reaction different buildings have different things but that's how you kind of spread them out naturally um so there's your bonus tip is the build grids don't get too carried away but you know what give it a shot all right and one last thing how do I actually find a game Mr winter well I don't have that issue because I am a d-list e-celebrity so almost the time I can find some people to play but how many people are actually playing I'm recording this at I don't want to admit but it's not oh but it is technically on the screen but but which 7 PM is it yeah anyways so fun fact this is actually something really cool I can stay in this game against the AI and and now we're going on I want to play how do I play so a multiplayer battle list also you can go on the Discord uh as well look for games find some things uh ask for so there's a general here here on the current version of the lobby list which changes a lot all right games in green have players but I have not started games in yellow I've started there's a few of them uh and in blue are open servers or servers that no longer have players in them that that players have started so you can see some of them have been changed by by players and their names and such so you can choose to wait for another game to roll around but here here's something you can do say you find a Lobby like uh Noob town now I wouldn't necessarily trust all the lobbies to to be only noobs but usually players are under rank 20 or so so let's see let's just jump into this Lobby game is in progress for 24 minutes that's pretty long time let's join the next one I can't join right now but I can add myself to the queue there you go so now I'm just going to do exclamation point notify so I can go back to my game and it'll notify me when that game ends and it's very likely that there will be a slot for me when that ends I gotta actually because I'm not gonna play that game and then they're gonna be nope ah it actually just did okay well that is my favorite method for when I'm just chilling I want to play against AI or because it's a little easier to jump into one of those lobbies that's already rolling then start a new one but uh of course uh just ask around and you can find some more info so hopefully I didn't nearly I barely I didn't even touch on the gameplay I didn't touch anything but those are all uh the settings the hotkeys commands the basic controls and UI uh that I like to oh oh I said bonus tip I keep saying bonus team but if you keep the metal view on which shows you the metal it's F7 on green the whole team is wasting I like it more you it's a little harder to tell what's out of vision range but you should pretty much always have radar uh and it kind of lights up the map a bit so uh I kind of like the have leaving the metal view on and on top of that it it clearly shows you which metal is not taken yet which is very important to take so get try it out give it a shot so you like it leave a comment thank you for watching I hope this was educational entertaining somewhere in between that's what I'm going for let me know the tips I definitely missed uh what guides you want to see and um thank you for watching like subscribe really appreciate it if you're you're watching this and you thought you were subscribed and it it was actually to the main channel for Starcraft and not this channel well this is you made it to the end so you probably enjoy it so thank you for watching I'll see you next time uh have a great day good luck have fun stay tuned stay unreasonable
