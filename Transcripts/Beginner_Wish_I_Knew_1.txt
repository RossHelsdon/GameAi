In this video I’ll cover a few really important
things I wish I knew when I started playing Beyond All Reason. These tips are game changing, let’s get
started with some basics! Find your commander any time by pressing Ctrl+C
You can see all your idle buildings and workers here and can cycle through them with Ctrl+B.
And if you hear a ping or alert, press F3 to see it. Now your commander comes with the D-gun. [hotkey D]
For 500 energy you can one hit kill anything in its path but it has a short range. So obviously you can’t just walk up to an
experimental unit and try this, instead you’ll need to learn about your cloak. [hotkey K]
Cloaked units that stand still cost only a little bit of energy per second; it costs
more if you move. Note that cloaked units will still appear
on the radar and can be revealed by countermeasures or if an enemy gets too close to you. Your commander has the highest build power
in the game! Use it to assist with critical projects! And notice how your commander has a line of
sight and this farther green dotted range? That’s your radar range. It can allow you to attack units and buildings
beyond your line of sight. However, attacking into the fog of war is
pretty inaccurate. Later on, at tier 2, you can build structures
which increase the accuracy of long range fire but the buff gets smaller with each building
so it’s advised to build no more than 3 for an entire allied team. Also, radar can’t see past physical barriers
so try to place them up high and near the edge of the terrain to get the best view possible. And don’t forget that you can dumb fire
into the fog of war if you know enemies or structures are there. Be sure to check BAR’s really helpful online
guides and Discord to learn even more tips and tricks that I didn’t cover On to building and combat tips worth knowing
right away: [One metal extractor per deposit]
If you plan on using wind energy, hover your mouse over the wind icon to note the average
wind power on your map and to learn if wind power is even viable. So you know how to hold shift to queue up
any action right? Let’s say you want to insert an action in
front of a queue without canceling and starting over. Just hold the Spacebar when you add a new
action to insert it to the front of the queue. You can also use SHIFT to build multiple things
in a line, hold SHIFT+ALT to build in a rectangle, And multiple constructors can split the queue
amongst them. But beware, buildings explode when destroyed
and this can cause a chain reaction … Devastating! To prevent this, space your building out. [Shift+Alt+Z or X]
Once a building or unit is placed, click on them and hold Space + X to see 2 red rings
that show the explosion radius for death and a glowing one for self detonation (Ctrl+D)
which is useful for surprising enemy swarms and preventing them from reclaiming your metal. Finally, if you build basic solar collectors
or Tier 1 Energy-to-Metal converters, you can reclaim these less efficient buildings
once you get started on Tier 2 to reclaim a good amount of metal that you might be needing. Phew…That’s enough for building shortcuts,
now let’s look at some army commands. Ctrl+Click will get your group to move in
formation (That means, they’ll move at the speed of the slowest unit in the group). If you hold click and move your mouse in a
line, your selected army will set themselves up evenly across the line you drew. Excellent for perching an army next to a cliff
or around units. Don’t forget that flanking an enemy or building
(meaning you attack them from more than one side) will increase the total amount of damage
your units can output. And note that at max range lasers only do
50% damage but this increases up to 100% you’re right up against them. Some actions like repairing, attacking, and
reclaiming can be set to an area by clicking and dragging on the object. This creates a round zone of action for your
units. OK, now let’s say that you’re producing
units like crazy and lost track of where some of them went. No problem! Just select the units you’re looking for
and press Ctrl+Z to select all of them on the entire map! You can also double click to do the same thing
but this will only capture the ones within your view screen. Here are some final tips you may not know. Units with higher ranks have reduced reload
times and higher health! Bots have a greater ability to traverse rough
and hilly terrain than vehicles do. However, amphibious vehicles can move along
uneven terrain as well and hovering vehicles cannot be attacked by underwater torpedoes
from submarines. The corners of a unit’s icon show whether
it can attack air, land, or under water! There’s some really critical info here: And when you're setting up a game you can
change locations, number, and the size of the spawn zones. There’s also tons of ways to customize your
gameplay experience, for example, under Accessibility you can specify that teams can share one colour
or everyone can have their own. Finally, hold Alt and slide your mouse to
the edge of the screen or use the middle mouse button to change your perspective. Don’t forget to sub and share my channel
with others. I make all sorts of funny reviews and easy
to follow guides!
