g'day fellows and welcome to another beyond all reason video where we're going to be doing an overview of the front line this has been a hotly requested video obviously a lot of the content that we've been doing is focused around the back line about being greedy but today we're going to take a look at a frontliner who is a very good player now doesn't currently sit on the leaderboard but still very very high true skill rating and that is going to be spot a friend spot a friend is uh I guess he's probably good friends with spider friend and he's going to be playing the Frontline position here over on the left hand side of the screen so without further Ado let's get to it I'm gonna skip the start and jump in take a look exactly how he begins so looks like it's going to be a single Max opening here we can see that he's got all three of the Max's queued up and we're right on board with his player view here now it's important to note that he is on the edge of the map the edge of the map is arguably a little bit more sensitive than the center of the map which is simply because if you make a mistake in the center of the map there's a lot more people who can cover for you as an example if you if you let some units run by then other people can cover for you but if you let units run by on the edge of the map well there's not really many people who can cover for you so it's always important to note that you are playing a little bit more of a a difficult position so it looks like it's going to be a wind opening now one thing to note is wind is quite high for him here so I suspect he probably would have gone Solas uh if the wind was low but obviously With the Wind being quite high he says you know what I'm gonna go with the wind so it's gonna be three windmills or three Winans three wind turbines there we go and opening up with a bot lab which is very standard here the most common thing that we do see frontliners do is go for an early bot lap but then reclaim that and then build a vehicle lab a little bit closer to the front line and we can see that he has got a whole bunch of units queued up inside so we've got a single tick and three construction Bots he's gone for he's changed he said I want two ticks and three construction bots so we're gonna be focusing on two core components of this game the first part is the bass and the second part is the front line that's going to be it so those are two very different things and we're going to be talking about the roles that he's looking to fulfill here so as a frontliner your job is to defend your backline you want to make sure that your backline's safe so they can focus as much of their energy on just looking at ecoing and getting those T2 units out but at the same time it's also about harassing the enemy backliner so that you're keeping them down we can see that that's what these ticks may look to do here as he comes out and just looks to scout out what's happening in the middle of the map behind this we've seen that he's gone for three construction Bots and anytime that he's stalling energy we can see that he's boosting out these construction units anytime that he's stalling on energy he's going to turn around and make a solar collector which is actually really smart because the solos only cost metal compared to the energy that the wind gens cost so it goes up to a total of two and is now going to begin moving out with the commander he's going to want to get that Commander into the middle of the map very very quickly the normal goal that I look for is about four minutes 30 and that's somewhere along this line around here so we can see the fleas at the moment he's going to be looking to defend enemy fleas let's see if he reacts to that and look you can see the reaction immediately throws out 10 fleas straight away now one of those first construction Bots that we've seen has come over and began working on energy this is really important because as the commander moves out across the map he's not going to be stopping at every single metal deposit he's just going to be working his way forward and we can see him on the way up he's going off and starting at one two three four he's not going in and out but at the same time a little bit of a counter attack over here and we can see that even though this attack is happening in the middle he he is making sure that he covers it and this is part of being a good frontliner because at the end of the day you're making units and it's your job to try and help clean up this mess so really what played here by spoda early on in the game and now going to be looking to change out the units that he's going for and is now going to be adding in pawns which is your your essentially your default infantry unit for the early game here as the arm obviously on the other side it's going to be the grunts we can see him continuing to expand out with the commander and looking to make it towards that front line it's very key he wants to try and get up to this position to begin that trench and ideally on that trench is going to be looking to put down laser Tire it's back home though we see it's going to be the construction turret that comes out so all three of these construction Bots are now going to be focusing on the construction turret it's around the three minute Mark three minute 30 Mark and he's putting it down and one thing to note is you can see that all of the construction Bots are putting down wind turbines within the radius of the construction turret so it can help boost them up and we now see that third construction bot beginning to move out Commander continuing to move forward we can see he's got that little radar spots the enemy units on the way in and it begins to throw down a second radar or not not a second radar the first radar on the front line this is going to give him great penetration through to the enemy backline he'll be able to see exactly where the enemy is and whether he can go for a cheeky little flank which is exactly what he looks to do here and he's going to continue pushing up remember you want to try and seal this little this little Jam right here but we can see those fleas heading up towards that top side it looks like one might get through and he's going to be able to do some annoying damage back here if he's lucky uh his enemy will clean him up you can see that we've got a look there's a rascal that might be able to clean him and there's the Rascal which should be able to catch it or I think is it the Rascal yeah it's the Rascal uh that picks him up but he manages to almost take out a a uh oh my God this this flea is being very very annoying here but it does eventually get cleaned up now back towards the front we see the commander has moved forward and he's actually taking very strong position now take a look at one of the ways that he's building this light laser turret so he's got the Commander in front and this is designed to protect the light laser turret from the anime Commander because there's always a risk of d-gun now in in the most recent change the d-gun no longer affects the commander so you can really use this to begin pushing but you can see that the way that the llts have been positioned uh so that they have kind of there's this sort of uh demilitarized zone in the middle that no one's really going to be able to go into at the same time look at this over towards the West Side we've got a little bit of a flanking maneuver coming through towards that back now one thing to note is it's going to be the pink player on the back client we're not going to focus too much about what's happening over on the on the East let's let's head back towards the base because there's a lot going on here so it looks like a second construction turret has been thrown down throughout this and still just focusing on those wind gen you can see Wiki his opponent in this Lane saying we are losing this Lane a hundred percent by the way blind uh so blind is gonna be his his laning partner in the back there Blind Fish as a as a commander goes down and this becomes quite pertinent because if that Commander goes down which it has and that's Fireballs Commander then that's going to mean that there is a bit of a gap here but now spodo frame is going to have to come out and cover so obviously his main goal is to stop any attacks from his Lane try and think about it as four lanes so if I was going to draw this I'm going to pause it right now just to explain the the concept of lanes if you're familiar with League of Legends or Dota 2 you'll understand pretty well but basically the way it works is you've got the these these two sides of the field right where you're going to have uh that you've got the good guys down here and you've got the bad guys over there and within that you've got lame so as an example spot a friend's Lane might end around here and and then fireball's Lane may end around here and that's his in the middle and then you can see we've got serious bot who might take over to here and then over on the edge of the map you can see we've got uh a tradies who's going to be having you know this position right here now obviously these aren't exact uh these can change around you know maybe you've got something like that where where this Lane can extend out over towards that position or something along those lines but essentially each player has got a a lane that they are looking to fight down or didn't mean to draw a label right there each player's got a lane that they're looking to fight down and looking to try and protect obviously uh these guys I've given them a little bit a little bit too little uh and now all of a sudden that's going to mean so if you've got your lane here uh that you're protecting well now all of a sudden this is a potential Avenue for attack from the enemy so it means that this is something that he's going to be very aware of and thinking about and I wouldn't be surprised as he spoke a friend come out here and look to drop some llts down uh over on the edge here just just to try and defend against any attacks so at the early stages in in this sort of tier one war the light laser turrets or the sentries are going to be really important to maintain control of the ground they used to do a lot of damage to the commander but it's been nerfed significantly we can see spider friends starting to push up here and he's actually in a 2V1 situation here so blind fish is starting to make make units and Wiki is also making units if we check his ally his ally is T2 he's got plenty of advanced solar collectors out he's having a field day back here he is not helping one bit so spider friend is really caring but one thing to be careful of is over extension especially if you're going to attract enemies if you start to attract enemies you're going to put yourself in a spot where you're maybe 1v2 or 1v3 and that's going to mean that your position will start to weaken so you've got to be careful not to overextend uh but obviously we do want to try and take as much map control as we can we can seem continuing to push up here let's head back to the base quickly just to get a bit of an idea on where he's at a couple of idle construction Bots for the moment uh so not going to be throwing down how many have we got in total of these uh of the wind turbines so 26 with the two solar collectors so not too bad and keep in mind he's sent forward a construction bot to come in and fill that back line and there we can see that vehicle lab going to be going down so commander not going to be moving back for it you can see he's actually oh God there's so much going on right now in this game so I do apologize because as a as a back liner my specialty is not not front lining and it's difficult for me to make a cohesive uh I guess examination of what's Happening here because there's so many things now one of the things that he's done is he's sent metal over to Kermit Slayer he said hey mate I I want a tier 2 Bot and that's essentially what he's done so basically Kermit Slayer hasn't reclaimed his bot lab yep and he's going to be able to provide a tier 2 bot which is going to help him uh buff up or essentially what he wants to do is straight away you can see the metal extractor he wants to start improving these immediately so that's what he's going to look to do here and that's going to really increase that metal income which is what the main focus is meanwhile on the front line we can see that we we are falling back towards this position he is going to be throwing down some construction turrets and it's still pushing up towards this this central location a couple of units do go through but they do go down and we can see now there is a third player that's going to be joining looks like just a couple of maybe a uh not a grunt but a uh what are they called these little guys right here the the pawn so uh gonna be coming out so now we see our our I guess our next level of units so just to explain a couple of things because I know that there's going to be people that are new to this game and there's of course going to be plenty of experienced people who are going to know exactly what I'm talking about but you know it's important that we we cover this for everybody so now the rocket here is going to be coming out these guys used to be called the roccos back in in total Annihilation and these guys specialize in dealing with static defense but only the Tier 1 static defense so if you've got any of those sentries or the big you know the Gat guns the ones that shoot the Green Lasers these guys aren't going to work but they work perfectly against these turrets now on the other side we can see that the thuds are starting to come out or I think they're called thugs now yeah the thugs are coming out these guys are really good at pushing they're kind of I guess you could say they're like pawns but a little bit a little bit uh slow up a lot a lot and a lot more strong um and they do have a lower range than the Rocco but ideally what you want to be doing is just microing the same way uh that Wiggy is micro Link at the moment doing a really good job to get out that damage uh on Spotify and you definitely want to be if you're if your plan is to stay playing Bots you do want to transition into the thug uh towards the the middle of tier one I would be saying I'd be curious to know because keep in mind when it comes to this game beyond all reason I'm not an expert yet so I'm just going on what I've seen if if you if you disagree with anything said please leave it down in the comments and I will make sure to read that and feed it back but tomorrow friend overextending a little bit here going against the 3v1 we see pink we see red we see white pushing through the Fidos aka the hounds are going to be coming in and doing a lot of damage we're in eight minutes so this is a tier two push coming out right now and we can see that that spirit is going to do his best to try and cover this angle and this is why we transition into the vehicles the reason we trans we transition into the vehicles is because they have a tier 1.5 option that is a very mobile unit so unlike the Centurion these guys move quite quickly the Stouts very good at defending against something like the Hound uh because the hounds are are quite quick uh to begin taking over and we can see he's struggling to put any pressure on here obviously hasn't committed to a huge amount of hounds but looks like he probably will and now we can see the communication going to come out so let me turn this sound down a little bit and let's uh let's get some music on so you can see that he's communicating help 3v1 now I'm just going to pause it because this is really important to note he's 3v1 he's quite literally 3v1 okay it's only him and he's up against three people now a lot of people might look at that and go that that's that's a bad deal you know if we're talking about trade deals this is one of the worst of all times probably but let's think about it from the perspective of what has he bought his backline well he's bought his backline space his back line is now throwing down a fusion he's got all of the Maxes up sold the t2 has passed out t2s over to allies and now they're working on their own T2 when it comes to this gentleman over here armed But Blind now granted he's not the best player but he's bought him space as well because we need to consider the fact that the red player is going to be this sort of T2 support player on on the back in the middle so he's bought him plenty of space uh both of these players plenty of space and let's compare the pair all right so now let's go and compare what Blind Fish has done now keep in mind Blind Fish has been pumping out Vehicles non-stop or Blind Fish he doesn't even have T2 here there's not even a sign of T2 here or all that he's got back here is a tier one vehicle plan there's no Fusion there's a couple of Nanos that's about it there's not a whole lot of stuff here when we check out the red base he's got the tier 2 but even then he's only working on tier 2 maxes at the moment no sign of a fusion hasn't passed out he may have passed out to you two Bots we can we can have a look you can see he's passed pass one out right now to Blind Fish uh we can see one that's come out this has come out from uh this this player here uh it doesn't look like we've got T2 at the front here uh definitely won't have T2 over here the point is that even though he's 3v1 and he needs help that 3v1 has bought his backliners a huge amount of space a huge amount of time so this is a really decently played opening by him even though he's over invested in his position even though he's lost his Commander he still bought a lot of space for the backline and that's going to give him or give his backline the opportunity to come and help him out uh right when they need to and it also gives them the opportunity to have invested in their economy it's just a pause it once again as as I said right like if you can get to a fusion and then start making units you're gonna be able to make a lot more units than the guy who's just been sitting there sitting on on wind turbines for the last 10 minutes so it's really about this whole putting the pedal to the metal as long as you can and then only taking it off when you have to even on the front line we see that same uh sort of philosophy being emulated to an extent or not necessarily being emulated but supporting that idea that concept so let's keep moving let's focus in on exactly what he's going to do to defend here because spider's in a little bit of a a little bit of a difficult position here and you can see that now the vehicles have begun transitioning he's we can see the probably the most notable vehicle of the tier one which is going to be these tier one artilleries and these outrange pretty much every static defense that you've got available to you with your exception of the uh is it the The Punisher I think it might be called which is the the long range plasma this bad boy right here the gauntlet so with the exception of The Gauntlet you outrange absolutely everything here with the light artillery and this is really what uh is is quite an important thing to take advantage of uh when you're playing into Vehicles excuse me for moving the camera like that still you're still wrapping my head around the uh the sensitivity of of this uh of the mouse but uh so he's lost the front completely he's lost the vehicle plan he's lost all the Nanos and now he's gonna have to fall back and we can see that he's done a pretty decent job with the t2 back home so he's got all three of the uh of the advanced Maxes online which I'm kind of start tempted to start calling amex's I know that that's a little bit weird but it just kind of makes sense right like Max means metal extractor that's why we call it a Max uh and then Advanced Metal extractor it would a Amax you get it anyway uh I don't get confused that that's what I'm going to start doing it I don't know if people are already doing it but I'm going to start doing it vehicle lab gonna get the vehicle plan gonna get thrown down on the backside and straight away we see a whole bunch of stats just getting rushed out back here obviously he needs to support the front line he's lost it uh and I think the most important thing at this time is to just keep a cool head right don't don't start blaming the friends ask for help really really important ask for help ping it out make sure you get attention because now we can see that Siri area spot is starting to help out remember he's got his own lane over here which by the way like when we talk about like static defenses this is a great example of a static defense line we've got our sentries on the front uh we've got a radar we've got a Sneaky Pete and we've got a whole bunch of our construction turrets back here now we don't yet see the advanced uh Advanced laser turrets yet like the Gat guns or the what do they call their I apologize if I refer to these these ta names guys by the way uh I I I let me it's still a bit finicky right there the OverWatch um but we do see them starting to come up over on the enemy side we can see right now the warden is going to be coming down here for compa uh so he's going to be looking to throw that down so let's ride back on board with our Hero of the Day spider friend as once again he tries to hold on for dear life as there is a really big push coming in you can really see the emphasis on Stouts here both of these players going to be going into Stouts and serious spot saying we need more units at the front which is really important to communicate and we can now see that T2 has been remade so back here Kermit Slayer has sold the t2 he's remade it and now we have some uh Gunslingers coming out Gunslinger Bots one of the the greatest units uh the the Maverick as it used to be known such a classic unit uh really really powerful once it once it gets out in these early stages and should be able to put out a lot of damage but we can see that the way that spot our friend is coming back here looking to try and defend this position still spamming out units look at it going to some energy as well but really relying on the Allies here because obviously he's been 3v1 but now it's time for them to come online we can see that armed But Blind is also going to be coming online a big big lot of fat boys coming out right now he's got one two in the queue it's uh it's a whole bunch of fat boys one of the one of the uh the most interesting additions to bar I will say that much and it is let's just put it this way I don't like it when my allies make Fat Boys those things they hurt uh and they yeah they are the flee's worst enemy and it's uh it's it's your fleas that they're they're the worst enemy off they're terrible it's very frustrating but a little bit of a switch up on the back here we can see he's reclaimed the vehicle lab now throwing down a bot lab and got a whole bunch of Lazarus out so I've got to be looking to get some reclaim off on the front maybe do a little bit of uh do a little bit of resurrecting and speaking of Resurrection or reclaiming here we go some Lazarus out over on the east side this is something that we haven't really talked a lot about reclaim one of the most important things that you can do on the front line is reclaiming looking to try and take advantage of the metal that's out here you take a look at this we've got 135 metal that sits in here and boom it's just gone straight over to demonizer so unfortunately wasn't paying attention lost the Lazarus in one foul swoop but now we've got a whole bunch of fiends looking to come down and break through keep in mind over towards the center we've we've got more coverage coming out we've got spider that is looking to try and cover this position looks like serious spot gonna be losing his Commander so the fronts are really beginning to fall at this point and it really just becomes a consequence of having to cover over on this West Side so it may just be that uh that our backlines didn't help out as much as they should have I mean armed But Blind is only really helping out with some really slow units which are great when you've got these these positions set up uh but when you when you're dealing with something like hounds the best response is probably just hounds for yourself just so that you can cover the movement speed and we can see the Stouts now going to be looking to close the gap on those hounds and force them back and you can see the way that he's cutting them off making sure he's not going directly into the fight but just preventing them from aggressing any further so that those hounds are going to kind of be stuck around here and he's looking to try and get this around here more units coming in from that West Side still a couple units up towards the top as well but he's trying his best just to to prevent them from breaking through because once they break through once they get to the back line that's when the real damage is going to get done but it looks like will happen we can see that fireball going for a ghost here might be lucky to get 2 or three yeah gets gets three of the hounds so not too bad of an effort there but it looks like we've got a couple of welders going to be coming out here as well but the hounds are making their way back and all of these units finally going to be coming out here for armored But Blind actually he did go for a few spiders a bit earlier I will take that back he did make some spiders over here so he is definitely making units um so we can see that the the hounds are running out of space though and you can see he's now going to be moving over towards that East base and it doesn't really look like there's much to cover it but there are hounds now so as long as everyone's pinging and communicating we're all going to be fine uh when dealing with that but now back towards the base spider friend let's see exactly how he's doing as he goes for a T2 so going into the t2 bot lab here not going for the t2 vehicles and starting to throw down a lot more Nanos now we look at the front line and what has he done he's made a whole bunch of amexes towards this front line he has kept it going every single metal extractor he's got he has upgraded to the Amax looking to looking to throw down a couple of pit bulls on the front but Retreats back for the moment I guess a little bit fearful about these attacks continuing to come through but let's take a look down on this South Side as he has got some decent coverage here with a whole bunch of grunts just chilling out or sorry a whole bunch of Pawns just chilling out for the moment and now we'll head back onto that front line and and take a look at exactly what the plan is you can see he's going to be transitioning into the Advanced Construction bot obviously he's already been given a construction bot a little bit earlier uh and we see it looks like we've got some Butlers beginning to come out so these guys are going to be able to help and get some build power out onto the field keep in mind there's a couple of really important uh buildings that you want to be making on the front line uh most notably you want to be going for a rattlesnake rattlesnakes are really strong uh pop-up uh plasma artillery a really really strong unit and we can now see that to an extent spider friend is relying on his allies he's relying on these allies to help push back on this position the recluse doing a pretty good job he's also got the hounds up here helping out but the front has been completely lost and if we take a look at the enemy front remember the the enemy front is maintained they've still got all of this all of this metal that is back here and if we take a look right now at the difference between income you can see that there's about a 40 30 to 40 gap between these two guys or between these two teams and that is just largely attributed to the fact that you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve all of these Maxes are not Gathering because they've all been killed because the front line has has fallen so a a really important I guess reminder or or a really important uh point to make is just you know your backline is out there I don't know who you are I don't know where you come from just watch out for your frontliners all right and I appreciate you want to greet speaking of great uh looks like we've got the second Fusion reactor coming down here but speaking of of green we've got our first Fusion reactor now coming down for spider friend now one thing to note is I'm sure a lot of you aspiring frontliners might be thinking at this point well you know maybe it's time to focus a little bit more on my economy and I think that that's a really relevant point but it's also important to remember that our economy on the front line should be incremental because we should always be making units so one of the best things that you can do is avoid going for an aphis until you've hit maybe around three to four Fusion reactors once you've got the third or the fourth Fusion reactor then you can start looking to go for your own aphis but before then it's going to really hurt you syncing all of that build power into an aphis and waiting so long for the payoff a couple of jaguars looking to come through right now not gonna be able to find too much presence here as the hounds are out one of the best early tier 2 Bots and look at this a little bit of a breakthrough starting to happen now once again remember that the the obligation of the front line is not only to secure the Run buyers from the enemy but also to make it happen on the enemy side and we can see that there's a bit of an attempt now for that to come through and now on the front line there it is the rattlesnake gonna be coming up so it's the cloakable pop-up plasma artillery an incredibly strong um unit here and we can see he's got a lot of uh how much have we got in here we've got three construction Bots we've got five bottlers so he went up to five Butlers and the Advanced Construction bot all coming out onto the front line here to help out with the rattlesnake and once the rattlesnake is up you can see the range on the rattlesnake here I'll draw it out for you it's all the way back here so if we have a look exactly what that what the front line hits it hits absolutely everything now of course there is a Sneaky Pete as long as he spots that out though he should be fine let me how do I get rid of you there we go so as long as he's able to to roughly know where those things are he can just he can just attack move or or hit the fire uh button in that area but obviously he's exposing that and he's gonna be able to clear that out now behind this he's going to begin adding in Advanced Metal extractors once again let's check back in on the base we can see that the fusion is complete he's going to be throwing down Advanced energy converters uh and I suspect that there's now going to be a transition away from uh wind turbines and advanced solar collectors so expect to see him start reclaiming these and expect to see a lot more fusions beginning to go down remember that the efficiency on fusions is a lot better than your Advanced solar collector uh at least if I remember correctly let's have a look 4300 metal uh per 1000 energy compared to what are we what are we running here let me see if I can find a construction bot here 370 uh for 75 so yeah if we do three 3700 you're only hitting 750 energy uh so it's actually pretty close it's pretty damn close uh when it comes to the advanced solar and the fusion uh but I I think the fusion is still going to be slightly ahead of it but I'd have to double check my numbers so anyway we're back to square one what's square one it's re-establishing the front we always have to remember it is our job as the front line to maintain the front we want to make sure that we're holding on at the front that it's not the job of of our back line to come up here and say oh I'm I'm gonna go up to the front and I'm going to start building I mean to an extent it is uh if that's going to cause you to lose the game but the main focus should be for those frontliners to be getting out here start putting the static defense down you can see now all the Sheldon's starting to come out at least what I suspect are Sheldon's uh we can tell by the way that they're moving no it's actually going to be the mobile artillery uh so the mouse is coming out uh very very similar units I guess uh realistically um but we do now start to see more and more uh more and more uh I think these this has called us well static defense but often people will call it porking uh I'm assuming it's to do with like porcupines uh porking um so some pit bulls coming down now so pit bulls obviously a a really really uh famous rapper but also an incredibly strong static defense item so we've do see the two pit bulls now coming out on the front these guys got some pretty decent range as well you can see they fully cover the pass here and that's all he's looking to do and now we've got the the take on or the the take on the take on the the annihilator it's it's the annihilator that doesn't have to pop up it's a significantly better improved version of the annihilator uh one of one of the best uh defensive tools that you can use very difficult to stop this and it's interesting the way that it sort of works in that the the there are different levels to to your static defense right like you've got your light laser turret that loses out to the thug uh and then the thug will lose out to your Warden and then the warden's gonna lose out to the light artillery but the light artillery loses out to the the plasma and then the plasma is going to be losing out to I I guess it probably loses out to the rattlesnake uh which then obviously loses out to the pulsar and then the Pulsar finally loses out to like uh tactical nukes uh and also loses out to your Intimidators or your long range plasma cannons we can see already on the other side it looks like we've got some pulsars that are online line yeah back back here so one of the things that you will see players look to do is do a pulsar creep which is where you slowly push forward with your pulsars using the maximum range here we can see that these guys they extend very very far back and you can begin to push forward with these guys so you start off with one here and then move forward a little bit further a little bit further just keep creeping forward like that and as long as you've got units to defend it that's a real key factor we need to make sure that we have a combination of units and our static defense we can't just go all static defense I mean you're probably oh my god did you see the amount of damage that Pulsar just did oh it is not a good time to be whatever that was uh there are some fiends my Lord they got blasted to hell in high heaven that was a lot of damage uh that you came to the wrong neighborhood fans you came to the wrong neighborhood all right let's let's watch on with uh with spider friend and see how he's doing as the pole size is looking to start dishing out some damage early on in this game now I don't know if there's a way to track kills but I I reckon that belt that bad boy just killed like 15 units in a single shot I tell you what that is uh that is impressive to say the least we could say that he he started to also clean up or establish the position a little bit wider as well keeping in mind that down towards the south side Fireball is not really helping out that much we can see that I mean he he's already gone for an aphis and that's pretty early to go for an atheist on the front line he's going for a second aphis back here um just I mean a little bit of feedback of avoid making those aphis's for a little bit longer go into the fusions we can see that there's already two fusions down here now uh for spider so if he went into an atheist here I think that'd be reasonable we actually see the aphis is getting thrown down oh never mind he's going into the third fusion and then we'll be going into the aphis which is definitely the right call uh always looking to add in the the about three to four fusions you can even go up a little bit more than that when you're making units just because there's a little bit more of an incremental bonus but now we see an interesting development as as the front line continues to develop uh we see an EMP so EMP tactical Launcher coming on the front line so I can look to utilize this against the enemy position obviously if he wants to go for a push or if he wants to go for a defense we'll have that option meanwhile I I so just to explain that the reason why we we don't go for the aphis uh for anybody wondering or we don't go for the aphis early straight away the fusion the cost of it is significantly less than the aphis 4 300 metal against 9700 metal more than double now of course it's a better deal but you've got to wait longer for that deal and especially when you're making units you're going to be waiting even longer so you want to do everything that you can to make sure that your economy stays kicking and that's why it's important that you go for those fusions early Big Shots coming through and it looks like a a nice little radar bot explosion in there maybe or it could have been something else but I think it was a radar bot that does the explosion and takes out all of these sheldons on the back line and now now we've got the Pulsar just cleaning house on on that front line beautiful little position that he's got back here and take a look at this obelisks now coming in and take a look at the position that he's got one of the things that I said earlier is playing on a beautifully done one of the things that I said earlier is playing on the west side or playing on the flanks like this on the edges you got to be a little bit more careful because the when it comes to run buyers you're really the only person that can help obviously your back liner can is quite close as well but realistically you know you're not you're not going to get help from from this side whereas if if it's in the middle it's different and one of the things that players often look to exploit is aircraft along the edge of the map here so one of the best things that you can do even as a backliner is look to position uh some obelisks along the edge of the map because it is inevitable that there is going to be a bombing run attempt on that position and you're just very easily going to be able to shut it down as long as you've got those obelisks in position ready to take them down and you can see just how much damage they're able to do just taking out the plane looks like it's got full health as it goes down but obviously it doesn't the Obelisk has has absolutely destroyed it now those takeouts continuing to move forward you can see the crawl is happening so up to he's got and he started with one and now he's up to four and continues to move forwards with this I wouldn't be surprised if he like comes down on another angle like maybe around on this angle here really really strong units and great at covering themselves as well that's another thing to note uh but let's let's check in because we've got the EMP missile launcher uh that is yet get a stockpile through and on the front line we've got the dragon's claws that are beginning to pop up one of the things that we haven't really talked about yet are Dragon's Teeth uh I don't know if we've seen too many dragon's teeth out this game uh sometimes you do see players go for like early Dragon's Teeth but not always the most effective unit they can be pretty easily overrun with like a T2 bull or something like that um and but I mean they're good at holding on early let's just put it that way which is what what their main focus is uh so big air is now starting to come out here so we see that that's going to be from the pink player who's the same player that is uh is in uh spiders Lane and uh that means that there is going to be uh some pretty big big presence I would suspect along this west side of the map so we can see back behind this that there is indeed an obelisk that's now been made back here nice and safe these guys have got a pretty decent range as well so they're going to be able to to continue shooting it at those planes before any real damage can be done you can see that they they'll be able to cover all the way back into the base and the first aphis is up and now we focus on and there's the attack coming through so let's see if any damage is able to be done here bomber's going to continue running past you can see all those anti-ash uh Bots are going to be helping out and now onto the back line we can we can watch as the artless continues to focus down those bombers and they're not even going to be able to make it through just completely getting shredded there and really really solid defense coming in from spider and great just awareness of what was likely to happen this game so really smart moves on the front line a little bit more of a focus on build power now so it could be looking at a potential T3 play here he's on 100 180 595 uh metal uh per second which is more than enough uh to support T3 so he could be looking to do that maybe go into a Razorback or two definitely going to be quite helpful but look at the the take-ons just or the Pulsar is just pushing up like this at the moment doing a really good job look take a look what the enemies got how many how many units are we talking out here this is this is a fair amount of butlers uh nine Butlers to help out building these These are coming up pretty quickly people's gonna be able to help out you can see those fleas now getting spammed so expect to see the uh expect to see the junos coming out shortly and just look at the pole size look at look at the range on them just how far they're able to shoot there's the long range plasma cannon now finally coming in over here on the east side so it's gonna be the Basilisk that looks to try and take out this position and this is where it gets really hard for spider because he's holding on for dear life and he's under threat from multiple different aspects uh in this game uh so let's go let's head in the player View and you can see there's a bit of a breakthrough now on this back line a whole bunch of fiends back here and take a look at this The Fat Boys breaking through it's it's a classic combo the fat boy plus The Reckless I don't think I've ever seen this before what do we got here fat boy wreckage really so many fat boys I guess these guys probably probably took their own lives of poor Fat Boys uh they they've got a tendency to do that uh so I get the next focus is going to be on the back line and talking about not the back line but back home and what the goal is so we can see here that spider is starting to scale even though he's Frontline he still knows that he needs to carry and it's very difficult to carry from the front line just very very much so because your ability to scale is significantly hampered uh by the fact that you've got to be focused on the front line whereas your backliner has had all gain to scale now whether they know how to scale is a different question as we can see right here unfortunately Comet Slayer hasn't been watching the the Aussie drongo videos on on going for greed in the back of the base here we can see he's made some you know these this is as an example what we want to do here is reclaim our fusions and put that metal into our aphis but ideally at this point you're at about 30 minutes I'd be hoping you'd be on at least 10 plus aphis on the back line here and when your front line is out booming you that's where it's like well maybe we we could have added more economy this game but that's also to say that that spot a friend's doing a great job here uh in in his own room as well one thing to note he's still got these fusions that he hasn't actually eaten up yet even though that would definitely provide him a significant amount of metal uh but the pushback is has been pretty decent they've managed to make it quite far back but some SARS are going to come out now and should be able to deal with these fleas but just like The Fat Boys they they are prone to hurting their friends and their allies their colleagues but now back towards this other side or towards this front line some pinpoint is going to be going down here throwing a lot of stuff down on this front line some beam is going to be coming up as well making sure to to throw down these just in case any of these ticks get close but look at the the Pulsar how quickly it's able to just dispatch of anything on the front line continuing to push up with these pole stars and you can see just how small these increments are making sure he's continuing to add them on the other side how many pulsars are we up to four five six that's gonna be the seventh pulsar really well played but EMP goes off looks like that might have been the EMP missile that went that uh that hit right there a little bit of a little bit of a glitch there so manage to hit the EMP missile and we can see that they're going to be out of out of action for another 20 seconds so still some time but not a whole lot to actually take it out not a lot to run through because remember remember these guys are covered by the pole stars on the back line and there's more pole Stars over here it's just at this point and beautiful combination now coming out as well here from Rockfish we see a classic combination uh the the Mauser the bull as well as the the penetrator or the star lights uh back here and I love the addition of the Razorback as well just a really strong combo that's just going to be able to take out everything uh from a range or and anything that gets close and now we do see T3 coming in for spider so his economy is definitely in a great place he's obviously scaled well back home he's on the three aphis now and added in an additional a couple of energy converters Advanced energy converters uh but once again he's still got a lot of metal in this base that he could be looking to uh to to reclaim so I'm hoping to see him do that he's thrown down his own anti-nuke as well uh just because you can never you can never be too sure when it comes to any nukes always important to try and get get them out early but we do see it looks like it's going to be he's gonna be going into a Thor here so Thor definitely going to be quite decent against these pulsars keep in mind that the Thor has access to an EMP itself uh and so you can just wait for it wait for the EMP to come online and then you begin pushing out EMP the backline and you should just be able to go through as well as it's got that Arc lightning that will begin arcing to all of the units that are crumbled up here in another really nice combination that we see coming out it's going to be the welders together with the Sharpshooters on the back that are really strong the welders create a great front line clear up a lot of these uh these smaller units and the the uh the back line is very well dealt with but we got a bombing run coming in it looks like it's going to hit the tier two if he takes out the tier two it's going to be a huge loss for him but fortunately the obelis on the backside able to clean it up so he will be able to reclaim it uh if if he chooses if he so pleases did lose a fair bit of uh build power here as well and the obviously the T3 is now going to get exposed which means that the enemy can begin looking to push into that we can see that there's quite a push that's beginning to happen looks like our our back line has finally come online with a couple of hounds over on this east side but unfortunately it's gonna have to very quickly head back towards his base because this push coming out from yellow is really impressive can we just take a look at Rockfish right now I want to check the stats Rockfish 7.7 million million energy and 204k uh for so he is uh he went very heavy Eco uh maybe maybe we should have been watching rockfish look at this he's uh is that Rockfish or is this no that that's not Rockfish this is Rockfish Rockfish is the front liner and he's actually carrying his team when it comes to Eco so I guess it definitely shows that you don't have to be backline to carry as long as you know how to scale that's really what's going to determine whether you're able to carry or not because we can see right now that that Rockfish is doing a really good job of with this push here and it's this classic three unit composition the Bulls the mouses together with the star lights really really effective at dealing with any threat uh and you just got to make sure that you keep your units up uh to a pretty decent look at all the radar jammers he's got out here why do we have this many radar jammers and look at this focusing on the T3 we can see the Thor does get out now uh for spider he's going to be looking to try and head over towards the enemy backliner I would suspect uh let's let's see how much damage he can do he's gonna turn around still nothing in the stockpile just yet waiting on that EMP missile to come out but obviously gonna be losing his own front line let's see he does fire off his own EMP trying to probably deal with it this this big bulk of units where does he go indeed he does go right on top of it but misses absolutely everything unfortunately so doesn't leave him with much space at this point we'll take a look back on the back line uh as T3 is now coming up and indeed he's going to be going into battle Max and look at all of the Butlers he's got he has got how many Butlers are we talking right here this is a ridiculous 23 Butlers all just crowded around like we will help you we will help you battle Mech uh but uh you can see the Thor at this point it definitely feels like spider just kind of knows that it's all over Red Rover from this point like obviously he's trying to fight back trying his best to fight back uh but when it just comes to the control of the map he's enemies at quite an advantage let's compare the economies uh so we've got 69k on the top side versus 63k and 1.3 K Metal versus about one one to one one point one so still very very close uh even though there's a distinct difference in map control the economies are still pretty damn close at this point I I wouldn't give a clear advantage to either team when it comes to economies but obviously when it comes to position in this game uh the back line is is ripe for a bombing at this point there's just there's there's no airwall that's up at the moment uh and I'm actually curious do we have any air that's coming out on that other side we do actually have some big air coming through doesn't look like there's a huge amount of uh of bombers just yet oh geez I tell you what that wasn't the way I I planned it to go so it looks like just some Avengers out at the moment some some Valiants uh and uh and more SARS coming out just just pumping them out negotiators as well and look at the stuff this R push this is going to be really difficult to deal with especially even with battlemax uh but uh yeah the T3 now at this point it just it feels like you're just getting crowded in a pawn a very difficult position to come back from you're you're one you're one Starlight shot away from Annihilation here you know one Starlight comes through and hits these Nanos and it's just boom boom boom all of these go up you lose your build power build they almost say build powder again uh you'll build power and then this by the same token these energy converters go it's all of these gone but the SARS now coming through and you can see how much they're just ripping holes uh in these uh I was gonna call them goliaths uh but uh in these Razorbacks here um but uh yeah managing to hold on pretty well these tanks are almost like 2.5 tanks that or tier 2.5 very very strong uh but yeah at this point it's it's pretty much good game here so obviously we don't have a victory here and I don't think there's any real clear message to come out from this but obviously this has been a breakdown in the way um the front line Looks we we took apart exactly what what the whole goal is the main goal is obviously to come out and to establish that control to establish that beachhead and there's the raid coming in the air raid a couple of uh these Advanced core I don't know what they're called there they are the dragons coming along the edge of the map the high winds or Valiants gonna be able to back them up and as long as this Fusion goes down that's going to be a good game because it's going to be boom boom boom just like the venga boys from 2002 it is going to be absolute explosions everywhere inside the room of spider friend and a whole bunch of hurricanes also coming in uh or hail storms coming in to uh to finish it all off and there it goes ladies and gentlemen that is the game uh in a in a very quick uh in a very quick uh attack from Air able to finish off that game but it wouldn't have mattered anyway I mean the game was completely over and we could see that spider even calling out I was playing front versus three a little bit of a tough game for him but honestly he did pretty well uh in his position I'm gonna say that much he did a pretty decent job playing that 3v1 so in the end he gathered nine million medal oh sorry 9 million energy 254k metal uh his nearest opponent was 12.5 metal or 12.5 million rather energy and 292 so his boom was pretty good I would say that their backlines uh or all the backlines in general didn't really have that much of a greedy boom um backlines seem to very involved in this game uh compared to the games that I'm used to watching you know your typical MBT games uh those sorts of things uh but that's gonna be it um I'm curious what you guys think about this this style of of uh video obviously we did a similar one with MBT booming down in this corner uh so we tried to focus a little bit on the front line if you've got anything that you think uh that I didn't mention make sure you leave it down in the comments if there's anything that I can do better please leave it down in the comments obviously I'm new uh to beyond all reason even though I've spent plenty of hours playing total Annihilation they're very different games uh and I'm I'm always open to feedback so once again thank you very much for watching and we'll catch you guys in the next one
