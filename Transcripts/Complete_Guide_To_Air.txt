good day fellas and welcome to another beyond all reason video today's guide is going to be based around the most important role on the team air if you don't have this role on your team and the enemy does you're in trouble and vice versa replies so it's always great to have somebody on your team that's going air and often people don't know how to play it so that's what this video aims to fix now you've got no excuse you can get on in there there's going to be three parts to this video the first part we're going to be taking a look at a basic framework build order that you can use on any map in any circumstance whether you want to start air or whether you want to go into air a little bit later second we're going to be taking a look at a top level Pro player game uh where they look to uh do a similar build order and have a an amazing success rate with it the third thing that we're going to be looking at is just a custom game where I'm going to be showing you some techniques that you can be using with your aircraft so without further Ado let's get into it it is time to take a look at the opening build order so as all good build orders open we focus on our Maxes first it's important to note that we're picking the core here and that's very specific the core one of the strongest or the strongest Air faction in my opinion mainly because they've got access to the shuriken the shuriken is a tier one stun plane aircraft I guess you'd call it uh and it is incredibly strong allows you to deal with raids effectively but we'll get more to that later early on we've thrown down the solar collector just to make sure that we are able to bank up some of that energy so we can complete the third Max and now we go into our second solar collector we're going to follow that up with a bot lab that is correct a bot lab and the reason why we do this is because aircraft are expensive construction aircraft are expensive just generally aircraft are very expensive on energy so we're going to start off with a bot lab that way that we've also got a bit of flexibility and what we can do there's nothing that stops us from getting a Lazarus out there's nothing that stops us from getting a couple of of AKs out or or uh what are they they're called grunts I think they they're called now and we can help out the front if we need to with some AK or or some grunts or we can look to reclaim the rocks on the back or if we're on Supreme straight we can look to reclaim uh the energy that are in the trees on Supreme straight so there's lots of different applications that we can use with the bot lab but it's really key that we start with it because we'll eventually get into aircraft and look there are more advanced builds uh that you can go I want you to understand this is a basic framework that you can use you can learn you can apply and have a bit of an idea of the steps that you want to go through so with our first construction bot coming out we're going to make our me and then we're going to come back and we're going to make a nano now it's important to note the positioning of this Nano you can see we've we're covering all three of our starting mexes with this always really important because when we get to tier 2 eventually or when we buy a T2 bot we're going to make sure that the this guy is helping out uh build all of those the commander at the same time is just going to be working on wind turbines throughout all of this and whenever you've got that spare energy what we're going to be doing is just making sure we top off th those construction Bots make sure that we get them out second Constructor bot is going to also come out here build a metal extractor and is just going to Simply make a whole bunch of turbines right at the back of the map we're just going to forget about that bad boy he he he's got he's lost to the wind uh or Gone With the Wind I guess you could probably say and the third construction bot is going to be doing the same thing now it's important to note where we're building our wind turbines we're making sure that we're building these within the range of our construction turret you can see right now that everything here is Right within that construction turret range and now our commander is going to come help out with the construction turret making sure that we utilize the extra energy that we've got and if ever we were to fall low on this energy we would make sure that we come over and build some turbines and now you can see we've run into a bit of an issue we've stored on our metal so what are we going to do we're going to reclaim our bot lab and we're going to reinvest this metal into an aircraft plant so we've just started off very very slowly now keep in mind this is a basic framework you can keep your Bot lab up for a little bit if you want to go into grunts if you want to get a couple more lazerus out then feel free to do it but you may run into issues with metal if that's the case maybe avoid looking adding in this Nano so early because it does require quite a bit of metal but you can see we've now got the storage up this is very key we always want to be building huge amounts of wind turbines when we're playing air just because of the amount of energy that's required to build those units so now we're going to throw down our aircraft plant here this is quite early about 3 minutes into the game at this point there's a good chance that your backline might be harassed by ticks or Rovers or something annoying like that and I realistically there's not a lot that you can do apart from sending out a couple grunts but when the next waves come through you're going to have access to the shuriken a light paralyzer drone it's really important that you are cognizant of this unit you understand what it does you understand how it works and what you can do uh to prevent raids from happening because that is one of your jobs as an air player we'll just pause the game right now as an air player you've got four jobs and that is one of those jobs we'll talk about the other jobs a little bit later on so our commander he's going to go and begin work on our uh energy converters it's really important that we have energy converters here remember that with your energy converters that they will turn off if you run out of energy above that threshold we always want to keep our slider nice and high just in case the wind does go to ship you can see at the moment it's 16 out of 16 which is always feeling good but now we can focus on what our next stage of the plan is next stage of the plan I'm going to get 10 Fighters out this is important we really want to get these Fighters out because if a bombing run comes through or a couple of light gunships come in we need an answer to that that's really important that we have that as a team because all it takes are five six bombers to come through do a bombing run right here do a bombing run here bombing run on your back line and you've got absolutely no chance anymore you you are sent back to the Stone Age so just having this as an insurance policy to make sure that if the enemy is going air you're going to be able to have a response to that in addition to that so we're going to we're going to close it out now you can see I'm I'm I'm pausing the game there's really not much more to this early on all it is about is just scaling our build power scaling our uh our energy and scaling our metal that's that's it that's really it and we're just making Fighters and there's other options that you can go with as an example you can go into bombers you can go into uh light gunships if you're playing as the arm uh and when when we talk about T2 we don't talk about going T2 ourselves what we're going to be doing is buying off our teeker so this guy over here he might be playing Eco he might be selling his lab okay this guy in the corner though hopefully he should have a T2 bot ready for us at about 7 minutes if we're lucky and we can buy that from him we might have to stop production while we do it but that's okay we'll buy it from him we can make sure that we get an A Hercules out we can bring that bad boy over here real quickly and start working on our T2 metal extractors that's really important for us to do but as you can see all we're going to be doing is just spamming out a whole bunch of wind turbines here and making sure that we keep up with our energy converters the general rule is about 5 to1 it's hard to keep track though like at the moment if we take a look we're at 45 wind turbines and then you compare we're at at 9 energy converters so we're sitting at about that five we're sitting exactly at that that 5:1 uh ratio uh which is which is perfect uh but the they that's the the closest I could have you uh to a general but we want to try and delay our tier 2 so let's jump into our next Replay now cuz the end of the demo has been reached and it's going to be a game that I actually played on carrot mountains uh and I'll tell you now it's a game that I didn't win it's a game that our enemy won and the player that we're going to be taking a look at is a very high true skill rating player if I remember correctly I think it's a true skill rating of about 46 47 something like that which is crazy because that means that the amount of games that that person is playing they carry a huge proportion of them otherwise they wouldn't be weighted that high on the true skill rating so a a really really good player uh and that's going to be malady so I think we've casted a couple of his games before I'm looking forward to to showing you the the ins and the outs of of this build order so let's get down to it or or the the the start now remember it's that basic framework that we were talking about so malady is going to start off and we we'll speed through this right because we don't really need to look at the details it's about understanding what the framework of the build AIT is what what are the what are the guard rails that we're going for here so opening just the triple Max opening here going to be throwing down some wind after it then we'll be going into the fourth Mech we'll speed it up a little bit more because actually I think we're already at 4X oh no we're at 3x now we're at 4X um and so at this point plenty of energy being thrown down because uh m is going to be putting down that bot lab and the bot lab comes down and with this this is where it comes into that whole idea of flex you don't have to go for just three Bots and then reclaim the lab you can play into Bots if you want to a little bit so just going to throw down the construction turret here with the commander uh and you can see that beautifully balancing that energy any excess ener will go into that construction turret and in the meantime just making those uh those uh wind turbines and that's really what it comes down to right I just want to take you back to that framework and at the same time we now see a construction bot coming down here throwing down the metal extractor and then immediately just into wind turbines a whole bunch of wind turbines always making sure that we do the two row you can stack them up nice and close together uh like this because it it it's a very effective way to be building them and then at the same time we see on the top side of the base uh that we have got more and more wind turbines coming up and the command is going to be moving out to the front so this is what I was talking about when it comes to flex uh you don't have to play with the Commander in the base you know boosting up all of your production you can bring that Commander out to the front and you can assist the front uh so we're going to see more Constructors come out so this the third Constructor that's that has come out uh fourth one is now moving to the front he's a fifth one that's coming out so quite a bit of quite heavy on the constructors and we can see that that malady is just going with following that exact same uh plan in that it's one Mech and then just followed up by a whole bunch of wind turbines one Mech whole bunch of wind turbines and now adding in a second Nano and we're going to be seeing a development into uh what's very important and that is going to be uh energy converters it's really important that we have our energy converters online Mady will throw down the the energy storage and meanwhile this is happening the commander is moving forward it's important to note that on the backline here malady uh is responsible for a front but it's not really one of those fronts that you want to get out and defend like we see Elma fud doing over here uh it's it's one of one of those fronts that you want to delay a little bit more or that you can delay a little bit more and now we see uh some horns coming out but just remember this is an air build even though we're doing we're opening like this it's very much an air focus on this build order uh so we'll speed it up a little bit and get to it because a whole bunch of uh of of bots will come out here uh but the important thing is air air is what allows you to win the game if your enemy is not going for air it allows you to have an insurance policy if your enemy uh is going for bombers you can defend it now before we talked about the four different roles that you've got as an air player let's go through those number one is scouting it's your job it's your obligation to scout the enemy that means that you make a couple of Finks or finches or blinks as they're called now these guys are really strong at uh getting in Behind Enemy Lines and just scouting out exactly what's going on who who on the enemy team is going air how what what's their current status with their Fighters uh do we have much tier2 coming through where where is everybody positioned you know on a map like Supreme straight it makes a lot of sense to understand where are their best players on the map because that we've got to watch out for that if if you've got their best player playing well that means you know we probably need to get a bombing run in on that guy because if we leave him alone for 25 minutes he's going to come out an absolute Beast a beast I was going I was going to say a behemoth and a beast and then it just kind of came into Beast uh which sounded like me making fun of lisp but I assure you it is not the case uh but one thing to note now for uh malady is we've got a lot of production or a lot of uh build power that's been scaled here no energy converters and the reason why is because all of that energy is being thrown into uh into these bombers now the first job we talked about it it was scouting the second job that you've got as a uh as an air player is catching raids or if a raid comes through it's your job to try and deal with that so whether that be through bombers whether that be through shurikens whether that be through gunships that is your second job your third job is to defend the enemy raids that will come through from the air so that means bombing raids if there are bombers that come in on this top side and look to try and bomb this T2 lab it's your job it's your obligation to shut that down it's your job to make fight figh if you don't have any or if you've already got fighters it's your job to get those up there and finally your fourth job is to kill the enemy with your air whether that be through bombing runs whether that be through gunships there are many different ways that you can go about it and already at 8 minutes into the game we can see that malady is going to begin pushing out here with a pretty significant Air Force at the same time an attack on the land and guess who's on the receiving end of it it is yours truly ladies and gentlemen I'm in the corner here you can see me down on on 29 true skill rating up against the 46 of of malady and you know you wouldn't think naturally that these two positions stack up but unfortunately malady scouted me malady knows exactly what I'm up to knows that I've gone T2 so I become a massive Target and immediately Mady begins to move down towards that direction and we can see the commander up on the front line here helping out just a little bit on that front but this is a game-winning move by malady right here because you've got that joined attack that the air the ground the bombers come through he's going to be able to spot out hits the radar takes out almost out the but not even going to need to hit that SP right like as as you're able to dish out some damage and and neutralize those laser tur or those those all your problems are solved right there and now the focus will move on to the next backline player so both 8D and I were taking in definitely a bit of an O oversight there from us uh to do that and you can see just already the pain that is being caused by Mal malady uh against our team meanwhile let's head back towards the base and we've got that that scaling of energy conversions uh you can see that there's there's quite a lot of them out but at the same time all take a look at the wind turbines we're up to 103 wind turbines we're at the 9 Minute Mark and now we've got some stalks going to be coming out here so expect to see some uh some t2s normally when when the St comes out you can expect to see a T2 coming through so might be looking to get a T2 from uh from one of these teching players if there if there is a teching player I suspect that there is but you can see just how much damage malady's been able to do here manages to split the back line open now obviously there was a gaping hole that he walked through but the Highlight here is the air the air is what allowed him to do that uh and to have such a strong force a a strong punch uh when coming through and doing this so now at this point the game is pretty much over right malady's taken out one of our best players 8D on the backline and that's not going to be the only one I can tell you right now malady is going to be coming in for more people and you can see Raichu in the chat right now Raichu is a really good player I think true skill ring 37 38 something like that saying malady won already and that that's exactly it we're 10 minutes into this game malady already won with air that is the power of air that is the strength of air now we can see Mady going to start moving into Falcons these are the fighters it's imperative that you have at least some some of these around because there might be a Counterattack the enemy may look to go for air themselves and now malady moves on to the second player up towards the North and this is just one of those things where it's completely untouched you don't see anybody on our team going for anti-air not a single even though this is a a pretty high skill Lobby right you've got a lot of good people in here everyone's already got their own problems that they're dealing with we we've got you know these players that are on the front that they're dealing with with these attacks that are coming through they're focusing on their economies and meanwhile malady's just having a field day back here so all it takes is that one person to go air and not be and to be ignored and the game is just lost and that's exactly what happens in this situation so that's essentially it I don't think we need to really show you much more than that I mean I can tell you uh that that malady is making a whole bunch of stalks I'm not sure exactly why this is but that that's not really part of the the video the M main emphasis here is just simply on this opening the fact that you can go from Bots into air uh and then from there you'll be waiting for that T2 uh from your ally uh so we we'll speed it up a little bit cuz you will see that T2 come through uh and you can see Behind Enemy Lines malady is still causing a lot of pain and suffering back there and there's the t2 being brought in right now so the 12-minute mark so not not too early not too late and then all malady is going to do is just make sure that he he uh builds up all of these Advanced Metal extractors and then from there once the Advanced Metal extractors are in that's where you can go for your T2 lab that's really key because the t2 lab take a look at how expensive this bad boy is right now you're talking 3,200 metal that's a lot so if we can take our metal income which is 2.4 for each of these mexes and we can push it up to 9.5 that's that's a massive difference and that allows us to support that so once normally once you see these these four main Advanced uh metal extractors coming through that's when you will expect to see the aircraft plant be reclaimed and the t2 uh Advanced aircraft plant come down so I expect to see that quite shortly here but that that's essentially it so let's get through to the third part of our game here and we'll just talk about a couple of things that you can do uh we might change the map here let's just get let's just get a Glitters game in I'm going to remove my AIS as well uh and we'll just talk about a couple of little things that you can do uh just to help you out uh in the games that you're playing because there's a lot of techniques that maland uses that other other top level players are using that initially when I I came into the game I was a bit confused how how are you doing that you know that's a that's a really cool technique I'd love to be able to to do that so let's jump into it and and show you exactly how to do those things so we're going to start off uh the the very first thing is just with the concept of a fighter wall a fighter wall is where you build up a large wall of aircraft and these are going to be defensive Fighters and it's imperative that when you've got this that you are typically we want to be doing those with T2 T1 you can make a lot of T1 that that's absolutely fine the problem is that they are they don't have stealth and they will get exposed to things like enemy Mercury there's a whole raft of issues and I guess one of the other things that we can probably touch on before we we get into this is just when it comes to your if if you if you're going to do an a fighter tier list just FYI the if if we're talking pound for pound so that means for metal costs um the T1 Fighters are actually really good so let's just put on some cheats right now uh just so that we're able to build everything nice and quickly um so the T1 Fighters are really good the arm T1 fighter in particular is quite strong but the best t or the best fighter in the game uh Bar None is by far uh the t2 Fighter for the core and that's part of the reason why cor are so good because you've got access to the shuriken and you've also got access to the Nighthawk uh which is that that that T2 fighter so setting up a a a um a a an air wall is is quite easy so basically what we're going to do is we're just going to take our Advanced aircraft plant we're just going to right click out here and I'm just going to set a patrol route so I'm just going to hit Patrol over here and I'm just going to do something like that and then all that's going to happen is I'm going to make sure that my nigh Hawks are on repeat and I'm just going to make Nighthawk after nigh Hawk after nigh Hawk and CU I've got the cheats on they just come out instantly and what that's going to do is that's going to set up a wall of nighthawks uh across the the uh the the uh the front of my my base here and that's going to protect us from any kind of bombing runs so that's the first thing uh that that we're going to be doing so we we'll we'll we'll we'll leave it that that that's more than enough let's get out some bombers okay let let's talk about a tactic that you can use with bombers now one of the big things to note with bombers is when they bomb they don't just throw down one bomb there's a lot of bombs that they're putting down so instead of just hitting one area so let's say you want to hit you know this Mech as an example instead of just hitting that that single area like this and and overkilling it with your millions of bombs as you can see right there you know you would be easily able to take that out what you can do is you can actually spread out the damage you can you can say okay well I know that there's three mex's in this area what if I just do something like that well that's that's that one I I I always have trouble with that let's let's try it like this we're going to go right clicking like that so how am I doing that well have a look at this well let's demonstrate this part first so the bombers are going to come in and they're all going to Target different areas so the bombs will hit on the first Mex and that also extend out to the other two mexes as well so it's a nice little technique that you can use just to get a little bit more coverage on your bomb so how do we do that so I'm going to hit a on my keyboard which is for attack and then I'm going to hold down right click and then I'm just going to move it to where I'd like it to go so maybe I want to go all the way down there there you go you get a a nice little bombing run that comes in on that direction now it it's definitely not the prettiest of bombing runs I can tell you that much and that's partly because uh of of the fact that we have have put all of our our bombers into a uh into separate areas ideally what we want is we want our bombers to stack up all on top of each other uh it makes them a lot more potent and it keeps all of the attacks together I don't know what happened to you mate you you were going absolutely fine and then you just you just kind of wandered off over there uh but that that's essentially what we want and then that way we can come through and we want to do a bombing run we just go like that so you you can uh you can uh put these together so one of the best ways uh to do this is let's say we're attacking the enemy right now uh we we might look to come through the caves area because this part is typically a little bit less defended because it's harder to get units up onto these platea so you can kind of utilize the the lack of line of sight and the lack of build area so we might bring our bombers through down here and we're going to say okay who's our first Target this guy so what we're going to do is we're going to come in like this and we're going to just make sure that our bombing run hits these and you can see the bombs are already getting dropped they're going to land and now we come down onto that this guy and I'm going to drop these bombs straight down here boom and as soon as I hear those bombs drop from the plane I I'm just going to stop stop the command there they go all right next one back over here now let's go onto the next guy and we're just doing a bombing run and if you're enemy does not have a response to this it is just absolute GG right here now there are other things that you can utilize when you're doing this bombing run scouting as an example is great to know uh because if you Scout where your enemy's production buildings are instead of you you know hitting these spots you can see how I'm just kind of hitting the Maxes right there and I'm I'm just doing you know I'm I'm visiting the the the entirety of the enemy base uh and then going for it you can have a little bit more Intel about exactly where where you're going and what you're doing so that's always something to to keep in mind the next thing that we want to talk about is just when you're going for a dog fight so whenever your enemy uh is or whenever you're looking to get your Fighters involved you don't want to issue move commands like this what you want to do is issue fight commands so fight commands enables them to actually shoot whereas a move command I I'm not sure exactly how it works but I just know you want to issue a fight command so you just do that by pressing F left click and you'll get that purple glow uh so another thing to think about is that when you are up against a fighter wall so let's just demonstrate that that fighter wall again let's just get that bad boy out it's important to think about the mechanics of that because often people look at a fighter wall and think okay this is impenetrable but just for a second think about it from this perspective your enemy has made the exact same amount of Fighters as you 36 well in some cases it's going to be 10 times that or even 20 times that you know there are games I see with almost a thousand fighters in them on the fighter wall but you've got yours spread out over the entirety of the map and if they come through on a single angle what that can mean is they just bust through and just completely obliterate you they come up the line like that and they are just slaughtering everything because they've got critical mass over the top of you and they're able to to easily destroy you so there's a couple of things that you can do to deal with that so the first thing is when you see those attacks coming in often you've got a little bit of radar knowledge so you can bring your units back immediately when you see that the enemy is coming up for a push and often when they're looking to go for that push there's going to be bombers that are tied together with them so what you can do is you can bring them around like this bring your Fighters through look for those bombers and see if you can try and come up the rear and look to take them out that's always a great strategy uh that you can employ especially if you're outnumbered because the bombers they're the key targets right so that would be it and then finally the the last unit that we're going to touch on is the shuriken the shuriken is a an advanced unit a unit that is a little bit more difficult to use but hopefully this can can give you a bit of insight as to exactly the best way that you can use it so one of the tips I would give you for your shurikens is always make sure that they are on fly don't put them on land if you put them on land they come down onto the ground and it takes a little bit of time and you want these guys always out always ready to just go so picture this there's a little bit of a raid coming through over on the enemy over on this side it's our job as the air player to stop that so what we're going to do is we're going to take our shurikens maybe let's say let's say we've got five of them all right five of them they're going to be on a control group and I'm going to immediately bring them over here and I'm going to put them on a fight command and what that's going to do is it's going to enable them to start attacking the enemy and locking them down now it's not my job to kill them it's just my job to stop them to impede them to paralyze them and prevent them from passing through I know there was a lot of peas right there a little bit of alliteration for you a lot of a a lot of peas but that's essentially it uh and and that's all you're really going to be doing when it and uh I mean I I I can't really think of too much more obviously there there's plenty of other things to talk about but I want to keep this guide basic just so that there are things in here that are tangible for people that we don't want to go into too much depth as I said I'm providing that framework of a build order I'm providing you these General tips don't be too fuss about whether you play armor whether you play core if you're asking for a recommendation I would say core just because you do get access to the shuriken keep in mind arm get access to the tier 2 stun uh aircraft which is the uh the silhouette the silhouette the I think it's the silhouette stiletto stiletto it's the it's the Stiletto apologies uh the Stiletto um which is just absolutely amazing as well another St unit um to stop those late game raids but the the shuriken is still incredible uh but essentially that is it ladies and gentlemen I hope you enjoyed this video If you think I missed anything please let me know down below if you've enjoyed this video make sure you leave a like on it because it really helps the video out and of course I'll catch you guys in the next one thank you so much for watching
