hello and welcome to a quick F guide to Beyond a reason cortex Bots the first bot we're going to look at is the construction bot while it's only got a speed of 35 which is slightly slower than the arm it is much slower than the construction vehicles which are the counter part however they are bots so they do not get as much as a penalty when they're going uphill as the vehicles do as you can see from here they the same speed when going up a slight Hill as with our M Bots versus Vehicles there are certain areas of certain Maps which can only be traversed by Bots and cannot be traversed by vehicles at all as displayed here with this slope here so if you're looking to try and push somebody on this slope vehicles are not going to be an option for you similar to if you spawn up here and you try to contest the person up here this slope here is not going to be accessible for vehicles and that goes for going up it also goes for going down they are unable to Traverse the grave robber here is very similar to The Lazarus from Armada so in the early game they can be used to reclaim any sort of rocks or debris around the map for Extra metal income they can also be used to reclaim Foliage for energy income on the front line in relatively large numbers they can you be used to repair injured unit units they can also be used to resurrect dead units this will consume energy going see that they consume 1001 energy each the more you have resurrecting your unit the faster it's going to resurrect alternatively a quicker way to actually get the metal into the system is to actually just reclaim it at that point you are going to get a significant amount of metal income but if you have reclaimed some of that metal and you do that you want to Res it instead you do have to put the metal back into it otherwise you will not be able to Res it unless it's full the next unit we're going to go over is the grunt grunt is a fast infantry B for the cortex and it is actually a laser weapon so with lasers the closer you are to the Target the more damage you're going to deal the further away from your target you are the less damage you're going to do they are slightly cheaper than the pawn but the pawn has much higher DPS and much better speed so if the pawn gets on top of you you are going to have a bad day however they do outrange the pawn by quite a bit they have 230 range whereas the pawn has only it doesn't actually s say the range there Pawn's got much less range so one thing you can do in the early game is kite against them so I've got 20 pawns here versus nine grunts I don't I don't actually know where the other grunts gone don't worry so I'm going to pull the Pawns in and you're just going to keep the pawns at the edge of your attack range and fight them and the pawns are not going to be able to do anything whatsoever they will catch up and get a few shots off but you are going to be more than happy kiting them perfectly fine now again this is good for the early game but this requires quite a bit of micro so the pawns are a lot easier to use next up we have the aggravator which is is the rocket bot for cortex um it is slightly cheaper metal wise slightly more expensive energy- wise but it is relatively the same cost as the Armada that being said it has got slightly more line of sight by I believe 12 it has got slightly slower speed but it has 20 more health so they are very similar all around but this is going to be your main unit for poking enemy defenses as well as skirmishing with enemy units that are stationary so they do outrange the regular Sentry Towers uh only just though so be careful when you are positioning these if you try to use the fight command often times they will push each other into ranges of the sentries so it's best to just sort of move command them around the outskirts they will make short work of any defenses however their missiles do not track so if you're trying to hit unit UNS that are moving towards you you are going to have a little bit of a problem they do do a significant amount of damage and they can in fact shoot over the top of Dragon's Teeth they will not Target them however if you manually Target them they are not going to have any problems there so they are going to be your main way of dealing with static defense they are relatively weak and their missiles do not have the greatest tracking so you are better off leaving your units behind them to support them if any rushes come through they do not outrange turrets such as Beamers or the OverWatch however if there are units that are moving around in front of them the Rockets will go slightly further than what they actually say on the Range you can see there they are out ranging their range with the drop off so that's where the Rockets stop going and they drop the floor a little while after so you can hit this I believe there is a way to do this with the attack ground command if you know how to do it please comment down below cuz I am not 100% certain myself as you can see here they are missing the tanks quite a bit they are going past and hitting the turrets behind them the next unit we're looking at is the thug it is very similar to the armada's mace uh the only difference is it is slight L more metal expensive as you can see there 10 more metal slightly less energy intensive but that is negligible has an extra 100 health and minus one speed so very similar stats there all around they are plasma bots so they do have a slight area of effect damage uh when the actual projectile lands however it does not track so they are best used when walking backwards or kiting or against stationary targets they're actually very good against defenses but they are also good against clumped units that have little Health you can see here as I walk backwards they are quite happy at fire 360Â° because they are Bots and as the pawns try to catch up they are going to do significant damage against them on the front line they are incredibly good at hunting down commanders because they have slightly more speed and they actually outrange the Commander's D gun so if there is a commander trying to get away then a lot of the times you are going to be having no problems actually out ranging him kiting him and getting out of range of the D gun the commander does turn around to D gun you can always pull them away and because you are faster than he is he is not going to be able to get it off I should have had an extra AI there battle ended lastly is the Thrasher which is the anti-air bot for cortex it is very similar to the crossbow and that it is slightly slower it has slightly better line of sight and slightly more HP now these are going to be good early game for stopping enemy Scouts and if there's any sort of early T1 Flyers that are going to push you they are going to do more than enough damage to keep them off you the only problem being once you reach T2 their damage does tend to fall off by quite a bit often times you'll see these um if you're going up against an air player and you know they're going to be sending Scouts through or if there is a very early game push then you're going to be using them there they are going to be your best bet in terms of going against enemy aircraft however they are not the most damag in of all of the anti-air in the game but they are mobile one more thing they can do is they are actually amphibious so if you are planning to attack by the Sea it is always best to mix a few of these in while they cannot shoot while underwater they can walk perfectly fine and appear somewhere where the opponent is not expecting they're often accompanied with salamanders which are the amp built in the amp amphibious lab thank you very much for watching and I shall see you in the next one warning you have the last Commander warning your team is down to its last Commander [Music]
