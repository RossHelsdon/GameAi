hello If you are looking to get better at Beyond Touris especially when it comes to managing your base you are in the right place In this video I will show you a bunch of small tricks shortcuts and smart habits that can save you time resources and nerves Also if anything isn't clear or you have questions about how something works drop a comment I will try to answer everything For reference I'm using the grid layout So if your layout is different some hot keys might not match exactly Let's start with the basics of working with command cues Any command you issue can be placed at the front of the queue by holding space So if you have a builder queued up to do 10 things and you suddenly need to ask it something just hold space and give the new order It jumps to the front of the queue You can also insert a command smartly into a queue by holding shift plus space This tells the builder to add the new task but it will sort the order based on walking distances So if you are adding something along its path it will fit it in naturally Pressing N skips the current command and moves to the next one Useful if a builder is stuck or you want it to jump ahead to something more argent If you want to remove the last command in the queue just press Ctrl + N And if you want to remove something midb building Q just place a new building on top of the cued one It will cancel it You can control how factories build units more precisely with a few simple rules If you hold alt by adding a unit to a factory queue that unit will be placed at the front of the build order There is a small behavior difference depending on whether the repeat option is turned on If repeat is on the current unit will finish and then the old unit will be made If repeat is off the current unit is cancelled and the old unit is built immediately Another useful feature in factories is quota mode When quota mode is enabled you can tell the factory to maintain a certain number of specific units on the map So if you set five rest bots the factory will produce five of them Once that number is reached it goes back to the normal queue If a rest bot dies the factory will automatically build another one to keep your desired count You can use quotas alongside a regular build queue They don't cancel each other out The factory will always build in this order Units added with old then units from quota and then units from the regular queue Each factory has its own separate quarter So if you set five respots in two factories you will get 10 total on the map You can split a group of constructors across multiple buildings automatically Select a few builders queue up several building using shift and then release the mouse while holding space Each builder will pick a different building from the queue It saves you from having all your builders walk in line from one project to the next This is especially handy when you have a lot of contoured assisting and the walk time between new buildings takes more time than building them Now picture this situation Let's say you have 20 contrets assisting a fusion and you want to build 10 converters nearby Normally once a convent immediately go back to the fusion So you have to manually reassign them every time It's tedious and inefficient All repair fixes this After you queue up the converter select your turrets and alt plus drag a repair circle over the area where you are placing them This sets up a looping area repair It means that turrets will stay assigned to that spot waiting for anything that is building or repairing within that zone It's perfect for situations where you are dropping multiple buildings in one spot and want your counterret to stay locked on the task So it pairs very well with the constructor speeds which I just mentioned You can automatically space out buildings by pressing Alt + Z or Alt + X For example hold shift to draft a line of buildings Then add alt and press Z or X to adjust spacing Spacing matter because of few reasons For example it prevents chain reactions especially new in farabs It also avoids splashing damage from enemies and so on Spacing is saved per building type and sticks between matches so you can fine-tune it once and never worry about it again Let's talk about how you place buildings Now in Beyond Reason buildings explode when destroyed Energy converters and fusions are the worst offenders here Converters are extremely fragile They explode easily and deal a lot of damage Fusions are sturdier but when they go they take a chunk of your base with them You can see a building's blast radius by holding space plus X while placing it Use that to check whether you are placing risky structures too close together The golden rule is to never place energy converters next to fusions If a converter explodes near a fusion the damage can trigger a chain reaction that wipes out both and probably half of your base with them This kind of layout is dream scenario for air players or riders They can take out your entire economy with minimal effort Same goes for construction turrets They also chain react and any spacing can stop it Try to spread them out as long as you are not constrained by your building area Reclaiming obsolid is crucial You get 100% of metal back so there's no reason to leave old structures or Rex lying around It's also one of the main ways you will fund your higher tech Reclaiming every solar panel or wind turbine one by one can feel tedious but there is an easy shortcut Use the area reclaim command Hold alt and drag when giving a reclaim order to target only similar objects Start the drag on the wind turbine and it will only reclaim wind turbines Start on the tree and it will only reclaim trees This way you don't have to click on every building one by one and you avoid accidentally reclaiming something important And that's it for now The streaks might seem small on their own but once you start combining them your base management gets a lot more efficient giving you more time to micro your army or blame your team in chat If you got your own tricks or if anything wasn't clear drop a comment I will try to help out and maybe even include your tip in a future video And of course don't forget to leave a like and subscribe Thanks for watching and see you in the next
