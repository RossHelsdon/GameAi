To learn to play Beyond All Reason you need
to take it one small step at a time, because this grand scale sci-fi themed base building
RTS has several factions, a streaming economy system, three technology levels and hundreds
of different buildings and units all with their specific uses. I am going to create a new game of skirmish
vs AI as I would advise you to do yourself in order to practice what you see and learn
in this first tutorial. The Barbarian AI is as close to real players
as you can get, and you shouldn’t practice against any weaker AI as it will give you
a false feeling for the game. The download link for Beyond All Reason is
in the description along with a link to my tutorials playlist. Once you are loaded into the map the match
doesn’t immediately start. So you have time to choose your faction and
a place to which your main unit, the commander, will be teleported to once the match begins. Armada and Cortex are the already completed
factions while the Legion is still being worked on at the time of making this tutorial. I would advise going with Armada until you
learn the basics. The commander is important in many ways, and
can do many things, which I will explain in a separate video, but for now keep in mind
that he is the best starting builder you have and the most powerful damage dealing unit,
while losing him means losing the match. In 1v1 you lose immediately after it’s destruction,
but in a team game only once all commanders in your team are destroyed. You now pick the teleport spot for the commander
by left clicking on the green part of the map and a position which has a cluster of
closely packed metal deposits, three or four of them. Those are identified by the small white circles
with a number inside. The number part I will explain later but for
now remember that metal is one of the two main resources in BAR and that it is the harder
one to obtain. Do note that when playing with AI other commanders
will be placed after you have chosen a spot, while in multiplayer all players are simultaneously
choosing their places so you have to be quick if you want to pick your favorite position. But multiplayer is a very long story of its
own, and I will cover it in other tutorials. As time itself is very precious in BAR, being
able to plan your building placement before the match even starts is incredibly useful. And you do this while holding the shift key
and left clicking on the buildings you want to build in the menu and left clicking on
the ground to place them. If you make a mistake, simply left click a
new building onto that one, and it will be removed from the que. Do note that the greed circle around your
commander unit is its build range, so you want to fit all your first buildings inside
that range and prevent losing time to walking around. To see how much each building will cost you
to build it we are going to go into the options to toggle on a few settings. Using the advanced type of settings display,
and in the interface section, we need to enable the always show prices option. This shows you the metal cost of each building
in white and energy cost of it in yellow. You also want to enable unit groups, idle
builders, factory dock, and energy converter usage options whose use I will showcase to
you soon. In the second page of this menu you want to
enable the building grid option, and lastly in the accessibility tab menu you want to
enable the simple team colors icon and as you gain experience with the game you can
turn this off or use the different shades option for each player. But I will talk more about that in the multiplayer
tutorials. Because BAR doesn't have a uniform start on
each map nor the same conditions for energy production and metal extraction there isn't
a single opening build to follow. While this makes it even harder to learn the
game it also makes each match less predictable and more fun. Since you start each match with 1000 metal
and 1000 energy you will quickly run out of these two main resources if you don't have
extraction and production buildings for them. This is why in a normal beginner friendly
start you need to have queued up two metal extractors for your commander to construct
followed by several energy production buildings and then more metal extractors. Here I am adding three wind turbines to the
build que as there is wind on this map. Alternatively, if there is distance involved
in building these metal extractors you can build three of them at start, but as they
each cost 500 energy, and your commander produces only 25 energy per second on its own, you
are in danger of stalling your future building and production due to running out of energy
which is a large part of the build cost for future wind turbines. However, on a map with no wind, where you
have to spend metal for solar collectors anyway, a start with three metal extractors, even
if they are close to each other, and will drain your entire energy reserve is not a
problem. Because not only do you need all that extra
metal production since you are using it to construct solar collectors, you also don’t
need to save energy as those solar collectors don’t need it for their building. Each time you start you have to first check
what is the strength of the wind on the map you are playing by looking at the number on
this info card. The top number shows the minimum wind speed,
which doesn’t have to always be a 0, and the bottom one shows the maximum wind speed. If you are playing on a map with no wind at
all, as shown by this icon, wind turbines are disabled and you have to construct solar
collectors. These produce energy at a constant rate while
the energy wind turbines produce varies with the wind speed. A general rule is that the lower the maximum
wind speed is the more likely you have to add one or more solar collectors to your starting
build. Now about those numbers inside the metal spot. Those show the income generated by metal extractors
built on them. Most maps have metal spots with higher numbers
in their middle, giving you an incentive to build out, take over those rich metal spots
and defend them, giving you a place to form your outer territory limits and defensive
outposts. This is all precisely why you can’t create
a single build order in Beyond All Reason as you have to adapt not just to the starting
wind conditions on each map, but also to the speed of the wind once the match starts. Don’t be afraid to change your building
plans and react to a huge drop in wind speed by building a solar collector you didn’t
plan on. You can easily build one ahead of the rest
of the que by holding the spacebar key as you left click to place it. This forces the commander to build it before
he continues with the rest of the originally queued up buildings. If you have your own tips for new players
or want to share your build order please do so in the comments below and feel free to
suggest which gameplay topic I should cover in future tutorials. Now that you have learned how to set up the
optimal starting economy of metal and energy income you have probably noticed that in BAR
these resources aren’t spent in batches but slowly drained from stockpiles as you
use them. This is called a streaming economy. It is also the reason why your metal and energy
bars on the top of the screen have five numbers instead of the one or two like in most RTS
games. The bottom green number is your resource income. The top number is in bright red as that is
the amount of the resource you are currently spending from both your active production
AND stockpile. While the other red number shows how much
you are spending only from your active production. So when the brighter red number is higher
than the other one that means you are draining your stockpiles. The amount you have stockpiled is shown at
the middle, while the maximum amount of resources you can stockpile is shown at the right. The two red boxes on the resource bars we
will skip for now, and talk about in future tutorials while I need to make a small digression
to explain the white box in the energy bar. That one represents the point after which
energy is given over to energy converter buildings which turn energy into metal. This is mostly part of the late economy, but
can be useful at the start if you have extra energy and lack the ability to conquer more
metal spots. In those conditions you construct energy converters
which have a constant rate of 70 energy for 1 metal at the first technology tire. To better see and use this gameplay mechanics
is the reason we enabled the option in the interface menu called energy converter usage. It shows up here once you have constructed
your first energy converter and you can see how well they are working. When you are overflowing with energy, which
means that you are producing more than you are spending, you can move the white box on
the energy bar to the right to take full advantage of excess energy. But if something happens and your energy production
goes down, you can move that white box to the left to limit how much energy do energy
converters take and prevent them from paralyzing the rest of your buildings or constructors
which are also using energy. There is also a way of producing energy from
geothermal sources, harvesting the environment like trees, and from tidal waves, but I think
it would be too much for this beginners tutorial, so let's leave those for a future one. Going back to our stable metal and energy
production, it is time to now put it to use. Your next building should be a bot or a vehicle
lab. And for beginners a bot lab is probably the
simpler choice as it offers fewer, very specialized, units and the bonus Lazarus bot which I need
to make a whole video on. What is very important to know is that you
can click on the bot lab and in its build menu to start queuing up units even before
it is built. Again, there is no one build order for the
win, and depends on your position, role in the match and faction. My advice would be left clicking on the constructor
bot once, than holding the shift key and left clicking on the tick, which is a fast scout
bot, to order 5 at once, after that going back to the construction bot for 3 more of
them and than clicking twice on the pawn infantry bot while holding the shift key to order 10
of them. The constructor comes with extra construction
options that your commander doesn’t have. The scout has a tiny gun but a wide line of
sight and high speed. While the infantry bot has much more firepower
and HP. When the commander finishes the construction
of the bot lab you can select him and right click on the lab to add his own build power
to that of the bot lab and produce units out of it much faster. Build power can be considered a 3rd game resource
and will also get a dedicated tutorial video. This extra build power however comes at a
high energy cost so you want to be ready to stop it and build new energy production builds
as you drain your stockpile of energy. A handy way to keep expanding energy production
is to hold the shift key and drag your wind turbine to draw a line of them. If you also hold the alt key then you can
do double or triple lines at once. Those lines are dangerous as when power production
buildings are destroyed they explode and damage surrounding buildings, so you want to add
yet another key, this time Z to put some distance between them and prevent such chain reactions. So to repeat, that is hold shift, left click
to draw a line, alt to double the line and Z to add gaps in between. The gaps will carry over in all future matches. Same thing happens to unit groups if you use
ALT plus a number when forming such a group and additionally when each new unit of the
same type is produced it is automatically added to that group. On the right side of the screen you can see
the factory dock option which we enabled in the interface options and you can keep an
eye on it to see what unit you are currently producing in each individual lab. You can also click and produce units from
it, whiteout going back to base. Each construction bot you produce will automatically
add his build power to the lab he comes out of until you give him a new order. I would advise using it to construct a construction
turret as that increases your build power in the range of the turret as it adds its
200 build power to any active construction or repair project in its range. It can’t start a construction process on
its own but it can finish one without your commander or construction bots being present. And this is where I have to stop as I think
this is not just enough information to get you started but a lot to practice as well,
because properly balancing resource income with producing units and constructing new
buildings, which are both resource drains, is the most difficult part of learning Beyond
all Reason. Cards on the screen and links in the description
will take you to tutorials on other subjects but I must advise first mastering the content
of this tutorial as there is more to learn in this game than you can possibly imagine. Thank you for watching and happy gaming.
