welcome back everyone um this is J mun here and we are looking at the tier one turrets for uh defense in beyond all reason pardon my little men as they run through and devour all of these trees out of our way so we have a clearer view so um um we're going to be going over every different turret and kind of the uses you can have with them and benefits and negatives of each one the most common turret you will see on the battlefield and probably will be making yourself is the light laser Tower this centry here these guys are uh overall very good they have a very good rate of fire and a decent amount of damage we can see the DPS is anywhere from 80 to 160 which is pretty good and then the health as well is uh 620 Health down in the corner there which is very great so if you are in a wider open map and you want to kind of neate travel from the enemy it is very effective to just put up a couple light laser turrets so that they at least have some resistance before they can break through your line and that's usually what what uh defenses are used for is a type of resistance to defend against an O more open field that you might not have the units to cover um just as like a a barrier to keep them from passing so um for instance if uh we were on this map and I had maybe a larger economy and wasn't cranking out very many units um then I would likely put a light laser turret here here and here to just have Vision over this whole area and I might end up putting one probably right around there just to um make sure they didn't get through from the mountain side and that was if it was a 1 V one and I didn't have to worry about anyone else helping me defend now um the biggest thing these are used for is just a positional cover to main to just maintain control of an area and know that you aren't being pushed um their damage is quite low but there's still an effective way to hold off a couple of guys now this here is a beamer turret it's much stronger DPS it has up to 260 DPS so a little bit more than uh no it's not quite double it's it's almost double but not quite the difference between this guy and the light laser turret though is that it's a Contin ual rate of fire whereas with the light laser turret it's a single shot okay so the Beamer is very good at taking out large quantities of small units whereas the light laser turret is more of a burst that might be a little bit worse at a little bit worse at um massive amounts of small units coming at it so that's something to keep in mind the Beamer turret can be very effective at taking out large quantities of small units and it does have an overall uh higher DPS also its health is nearly twice yeah it's over twice as much as the light laser turret so it will definitely take some uh more shots than the other one a lot of times people will build some um just basic wall defenses around it and that can help improve its resistance a little bit but it's not going to be significant walls in beyond all reason are largely used as a uh deterrent from travel rather than a deterrent from gunfire the reason being is anything that shoots um let me see if I can get this thing to shoot anything that shoots can shoot over the wall okay so there there's very few units that these small walls actually block shots from most units can shoot right over over the top and because of that this laser turret will easily be taking damage from basically any side regardless of those walls even being there so um keep that in mind when building walls it is more to restrict travel than it is to block shots that is at least for the early game um once you get into the higher tier walls they will block shots and block travel but for now um with the T1 as that what is what we're looking at they are not that great at defending that there is an exception which um let's grab one of our Bots over here the exception to that rule would be these popup turrets here they are a lightning popup and these guys are the exact same height as a wall we'll give an example here um maybe get a couple more of our guys to come [Music] help get this built up no time here so the pop-up light lightning turrets are much more of an effective unit to place behind walls because they have I mean they pop up so they look exactly the same as a wall and when they attack they can attack right over the wall and they have a much smaller smaller body so it's much harder to hit them without hitting the walls first so that actually acts as a protection for the defense turret itself and lightning turrets are extremely good at at wiping out groups of units it's almost every time that I see a lightning turret on the field I have a little bit of fear in my heart because I know that they can the lightning can travel to several units at a time and just causes an immense amount of damage so uh just keep that in mind if you are dealing with large groups of units uh lightning turrets might be the most effective uh unit to build in the T1 phase okay we don't need a bunch of them two is fine um another unit we're going to be looking at is the gauntlet now keep in mind the gauntlet is one of the most expensive I think think it is the most expensive uh T1 uh uh turret that you can build and that's because it has an immense range now I want to keep uh there's a couple things with the gauntlet that we need to keep in mind um if you are trying to build one at your front line like up here it's probably a bad idea okay because it takes a long time to build just one bot working on it is going to take forever it takes a lot of metal to build which means that your enemy who is pushing you will likely have more metal than you will and could probably overwhelm your forces because they're going to have a stronger uh Army to attack with okay so with a gauntlet I wouldn't recommend building it close to an area where you're going to potentially be overrun another risk with building The Gauntlet is that is a signal to push for your enemy if they use common sense and they see a gauntlet going up they will attack you and they will attack you hard and fierce okay so keep that in mind um if you're building a gauntlet towards the front lines expect them to try to take you out before you get it up now another thing with the gauntlet is it has 1,200 50 metal needed to build one whereas a beamer turret has 190 metal okay so it's almost 10 times the amount of metal not quite it's probably like eight it's like 8 times 7 times the metal of AP Beamer turret now it does have a large attack radius so everything within that radius is going to be taking damage so that is one benefit um but the damage is very small It's 190 damage okay whereas a beamer turret if it is attacking it has a range up to the wall and every second it's putting out 266 damage okay whereas every second this is putting out 190 damage now the benefit obviously is the range it does have a very large range of attack but it might not make up for the cost that it has in metal whereas a beamer turret the metal cost is much smaller and has a large amount of damage per second so if I was to choose between a gauntlet and a beamer I would say go with the Beamer every time in less of a situational time where you feel the gauntlet will get its value say for instance you had planes and you wanted to build a gauntlet uh maybe right here or something something um Somewhere Out Of Reach where the enemies would have trouble finding it but it also has a large radius of attack okay that's going to be the optimal position for Gauntlet um but they're definitely very situational not something you want to build every game or in every uh defense that you come up with um obviously you know it's your personal preference maybe you find that you play the game amazing when you use gauntlets and it's just something that you're very good at using appropriately I'm not trying to dissuade you from that but just use it with a grain of salt and maybe re-evaluate whether or not that metal can be used in a more effective Army to push your enemies or maybe even in building up your economy um that's just something you want to keep in mind now um missile turrets these guys here are very important only if you know that your enemies have planes okay they honestly the ground defense in this game for air is relatively weak the they I think yeah air recently got a buff in it to make it so that the defenses are much weaker it used to be that one of these nettle turrets could take down a plane with basically every shot and now it takes like four shots to take out down one single plane so just keep that in mind when um dealing with air you will if you find out that the enemy has air and they are doing bombing runs you're going to want much more aggressive um damage for the air than you have in the past okay so you're going to want to devote much more metal to that um the the pop-up anti-air missile it does 170 six damage per um per second and it has 840 range which is quite large then we have the chainsaw the bomber resistant medium range anti-air missile battery this thing is extremely good okay if you are dealing with air put a couple of these around your base and you will be defended I don't know why but for some reason I always used to build these and I never built these These are so so valuable they shoot multiple missiles all at once and can dramatically reduce the amount of air coming towards your base okay and look at the range the range is massive on this thing so you would probably if for some reason you had air coming in you'd probably only need two one right here and one right here for the early game and no bombers are going to try to push you they will be instantly shot down oops um so just keep that in mind use your um anti-air effectively if you don't if you're not sure that you're going to have any early game air aggression and you aren't sure even if the play the other uh players might have air coming against you go for just some simple freret turrets pop up a couple maybe throughout the game uh just to make sure but if you know 100% go for the chainsaw the chainsaw is far superior in every way okay um there are a couple more turrets that are available such as the coastal torpedo um these are very situational obviously because they're a torpedo which is for water which not every map has water as you can see this map has very little not enough to build a coastal torpedo but if for some reason you do come across um a lot of of uh water say on like supreme ismos or something like that then these guys can be pretty effective at defending against a uh water bombardment most T1 water units won't be able to really attack from this range they'll they'll be basically at the same range so they won't have an advantage nor a disadvantage so I'm thinking in Supreme ismos where you have the the straight right there and this area always gets attacked by water early game um you could build a couple Coastal Torpedoes here and maybe defend against that so that your base doesn't get exploded um just something to think about um don't discount these as unusable cuz they they do have quite a decent DPS uh and a large range um 150 DPS which usually the issue with attacking water is you don't even have the range to hit them so something to think about um look into that in your builds and see if you like it the OverWatch turret this guy is just a in my opinion a better version of the Beamer turret uh it does a actually I didn't even realize it but it does less damage per second than the Beamer it's like why would I don't know I don't get it anyway it has I believe a little bit more Health than the Beamer turret so it is more tanky but turrets I would say should be a little bit more of a a heavy punch of DPS rather than a a t tanky I I would prefer my turrets to have DPS than tankiness because I'm going to have my units up towards the front taking the hits and my turrets towards the back putting out damage as a fallback plan and if I'm getting overwhelmed okay I don't usually use my turrets to absorb shots if these guys are getting hit that means there's something wrong okay that's how I play the game that's how I find it best uh you guys can obviously do how you wish but I just never use the OverWatch turret I think it's it's pretty lame I'd much rather use a beamer it's cheaper and has more damage and you know the health I don't think should be used I mean yes it has a longer range it can be nice for that but I don't know just go with Beamers Beamers are better um let's see I think that's about it as far as turrets go for T1 so if you guys have any more questions about turrets or you think I didn't give one turret enough Justice in um highlighting it or you just maybe disagree with me and think that I'm a lying jerk face you can definitely leave a comment and if you got this video uh like And subscribe and we will be creating more videos for you guys in the future we got a lot of things planned for uh upcoming uh videos and we are excited to work work on them and uh we'll be getting them out to you guys as soon as possible anyway that is it for now and we'll see you in the next one
