walls are they OP do they stop the enemy in their tracks or do the enemy just walk through the walls are there still a use for them can we put cool things behind them to win the game we're going to discover and find out how to use walls in a competitive bar match so let's dig in deeper and talk about walls so I wanted to put a forward to this video here firstly so I can give you guys a really good recommendation of another video to watch in conjunction to this and that's the defenses video by Conqueror i recorded the video you're watching now before that was released and I'll probably record another blade guide using some of the tactics Conqueror demonstrates in this video it's that good funnily enough we both landed on similar ideas at the same time of a defense patent conquer users with a maze and me with a more sparse dragon's teeth and checkerboard T2 walls secondly I just want to prime you guys for the order of this video i'm going to jump straight into five games which are a reasonable demonstration of actually utilizing walls then I'm going to show an artificial game and conclusion which looks some of the wall issues with a deeper analysis and I have a pretty cool finding about diagonal walls actually which doesn't seem obvious at all the first game I record is an effective and efficient use of walling backed by rocketeers even the higher west players we play against struggle against these walls and the use of combining walls with fast unit attacks as well which is important the second video I decide to delete pretty much all the footage just leave you with my finding when it comes to using vehicles and walls at least earlier on in T1 the third video a pretty crazy noob lobby with an extreme T2 wall backed by a pawn launcher was quite a funny match i didn't play this one i just happened to spectate it at the time interesting to see how the intense walling really formed that attack void which I'll be discussing and that's the subtle superpower of walls fourth video we're in a high supreme lobby we do see walls at least my new blueprint sparse dragon's teeth very efficiently turn around an absolute disaster fifth game we see the T2 checkerboard blueprint put through its paces works pretty well against starlights for example finally we play a contrived game where we experiment with big armies breaking down walls of all kinds we have some findings to show you guys before starting to produce this video I didn't have a clue about walls and so it's been a journey when I play best I play an aggressive game backed by macro not sitting behind walls traditionally so it was a real adjustment for me and I just wanted to advise you as a beyond all reason player looking to improve realize that walling you have to build the muscle memory for and to be able to predict the flow of the game walls are OP but when you understand the context of good walling and how it affects the opposition's behavior then it's really worth your attention and it's worth getting good at building to help you with that I have a blueprint downloadable file that will have the wall blueprints I'm currently using in them on the website check in the description box here on YouTube for the link let's get started in this game you might recognize some players here to start off with we've got some aggression against us we've taken down this run through from Peanut Buttery hay's moved up pretty early to come get this 3.2 mil extractor very aggressive with the Mexes we see this early Jiannis of course mixed in with rovers stonss must be wondering what they got going to do against this biogy pressure yeah it sort of has a plan which is to use shell shockers who have also received a slight cost increase I think at 135 not as bad as the Wolverines over our side we've got Peanut Buddy and Waza so this is a pretty intensive front line we're up against doesn't get much worse than this so I've made sure to start working on this T1 defensive line we've got three rocketeers pretty early up although Hayagi is starting to break through here with just Janice after Janis with excellent micro so we just push straight into them with pawns almost took down two and then we've got these rocketeers to follow up another attack so we're seeing about 150% damage efficiency despite using rock tears mainly and grunts so we must be using them correctly stons is has worked out the best way to fight Janus is with Janice look at this look at this oh so close expert use of Yanis unfortunately this one just getting hung up on a bit of rock stons's doing a standup job we're pushing back Peanut Nutty but that's cuz they've got a plan here to control the area with a gauntlet whereas we're just going to stick on our walling and that's going to be our focus now completely blocking this off now if we look here from Hayi coming forward despite destroying one rocketeer we survived it we survived that Janice run by or that Janis hit and run four usually quite devastating and we only lost one rocketeer so Hayi just withdraws and that's the last we see of Hayachi on this front here testing out the waters and found the defense is good so after that we see Hayachi come back around and we decide to meet Hayi back over here doing reasonably well at countering the Yanis giving Stonk some time to recover rog like here baiting out a Ganis hit coming around the side just being at that awkward range rocketeers tend to be able to hit rocketeers really require intensive micro to make sure they stay just at that 400 or so range and not allow the enemy to get any closer i'm very pleased with myself 167% damage efficiency i don't think I've ever played this well with Rocketeers before but we're starting to get worked on by some artillery building a sneaky Pete in response red advises a rattlesnake we get a little bit too close to these look what happened that's how fast it happens could have been much worse than that but we can't really afford to replace any of these rocketeers shell shock is getting a little bit too forward so it's always important for us to keep a mobile defense here of at least 10 rocketeers so we're moving forward here against this really annoying artillery force with a heap of pawns unfortunately there's still enough Janis to be a problem and that last Janis scores the pivotal hit so we see now a attack with the Starlight from Hayi coming forward here with the one Starite one profit one jammer so we counterattack that's why I've got these pawns for any sort of long range funniness to just reach out and touch them as soon as they want to try something like this starlight goes down ambassador goes down we've also got some hounds so despite this really OP front line with the help of Sierra we've been able to knock it all out possibly this whole line was too focused on aggression and not enough on defense and Sierra saw the opportunity to just run from sprinters from the side and take it all out so the game's won excellent play there from blue seeing where the really dangerous players were and making sure to take out their production impossible Dragonfly also done very well in the lane and this is what our defenses looked like in the end so some battered dragon's teeth we had one dragon's claw we got up again couple of sneaky pets and a couple other dragons claws surrounded by walls and building a big eco behind all of that i felt this game proved in high OS lobby this the walls are still useful and will force the other players to bring a different suite of units like more artillery focused and we saw that with Hayagi bringing that lone starlight to hassle us a lot of shell shockers used against us and that showed the use of then yes we build some rocketeers to help defend the walls but having a fast unit like pawns to every now and again go out and rush them that was pivotal as well i think the walls at their very low cost are showing their worthiness to be built okay on to the next game so for this second video I actually decided to delete it because we had very little use of effective walls and so all I need to say is they are not effective every single rocket came through that central location to hit my whistlers barely a rocket from a rocket bolt was stopped so we may as well have not built them in this gap the walls weren't useful my conclusion with vehicles in narrow gap walls like the anti- canyon spot or even the canyon spot it's a bit of a waste of time building walls with vehicles unless we're happy with defense only and to sit behind them with something like whistlers but I think to block off with walls with vehicles behind is a bad call as we cannot apply the same level of pressure as we can usually we can always threaten going forward with vehicles very fast that's why they're so good in more open terrain some walling will be good versus rocket bots in particular or other direct fire units later on like snipers but it's going to be hard to get that wall up where you really want it in the first place just be mindful of that but as a backup line it's fine and it allows you to have I guess a fallback position against a sniper push something that would traditionally be a lot of trouble for vehicles in this game we're going to look at what Xenoek's lane can do here with walls and it's quite illuminating actually we learn a couple of things from it and a couple of wacky things maybe Zeno the one has got something to teach us just in building the appropriate amount of sentry towers to man the front at a good number of 10 a little bit too far forward though if you're not going to defend from rocket bolts and we can see what we mean here is I speed up the game i just randomly joined this lobby i'm not actually playing it i'm just spectating trying to get games where walls getting used and found this gem so yeah together with the agitator the rocket bots dismantle that 800 metals worth of sentry towers really quickly we can see Mr balkan's doing a reasonable job actually here as the anti- canyon now building some walls themselves and know what it's all about about defending this narrow gap so I've got the bots so not going to be deterred by very heavy walling of the gap here over this side despite being the 15minute mark Zenoick has actually got out a reasonable number of mouses and it's going to be pushing back on all this very well played sir i wish I was this good at one chef let me go got a jammer bot got everything see guys this is what happens when you watch YouTube despite Xeno Kek being on about 18 APM and sacrificing Starlight so we know they're a true one chef just sort of knows what to do and also Mr balkans has got a few tricks up his sleeve as well we can see not just happy to sit behind here building the defenses waiting for these arbiters to basically crunch on him already taken down as soon as they've taken down one laser turret has been pushing forward with these hounds now the hounds aren't the best units to actually sally forth with and attempt runbys but they do the job they're quite fast they're nimble by themselves I've only got 400 line of sight so that 650 or so range is wasted but not even needed here the DPS is not really there either can't knock off these bases in time but you know not bad not bad even took down air's construction power okay so we can start to see the interesting part of this lane is this T2 constructor vehicle building the walls now you just might have seen it then i move forward maybe a little bit too late but we actually had a push here from red down into this zone attempting a slight flank and was beating up lightly on the walls of course the construction vehicle survived it so already the walls demonstrating how good they are especially the T2 walls are just shielding direct damage now the negotiators are threatening this jammer tower is stopping Dragon Gym from really seeing what's going on and Dragon Gym's actually asking for a scout so some advice to your dragon gym air's not going to do that the nine times out of 10 you got to do the scouting yourself at times I've actually built scouting aircraft to do this job but what you can also do of course is build a bot lab and put ticks down here but interestingly with that wall here right you've got it in your head that ticks won't even work where in fact they would they'd get around the sides of it but but they are seeking a complete wall off which is very interesting between these two natural features and we see this pulsar not put forward aggressively it's just standing off the line it's not trying to be any sort of offensive unit it's just trying to specialize in being a defensive unit interestingly this is Tech's pulsar and they're out of energy how does tech get out of energy at the half an hour mark that's what sort of game we're in still the Aphus is getting constructed mr balkan's being a little bit too offensive there so really getting down the thick wall on the side here for whatever reason so something cool we've seen while working in conjunction with the walls here is this tick spam right so not exactly rare to see this usually counted by Junos but look at the pathing here of the ticks very useful how they're not just clumped up together and all a taken out at once and then able to see this sniper push forward with all the visibility of the ticks they're able to be very accurate and also defended by the hits to the ticks so whenever this tick spam wall is eaten up on the snipers can go back a little bit and when the ticks manage to make a little bit of ground the snipers can move forward and we can just see how well it collects up all these defenses here it's a very good ploy for around the half an hour mark if you can time this all together at once before Juno's come out generally speaking a Juno will be built right away in a higher tier lobby as soon as this happens it really is successful and we don't even have to use a radar or jammer with this it's so effective it's a very simple strategy the snipers at the moment have 163 kills and I can tell you what they haven't all been spammed not at all they've just demolished this front line now Master Tom has sat off this wall and is not doing much either so Mr balkans moves down and starts attacking I think force attacking the wall paying a heavy price though and the T2 vehicle actually survived all that but only got taken down by the negotiators just at the end so the hounds must have got some visibility on that advanced vehicle constructor guns comes forward the commander right I'm going to sort this out oh no finally we see some push back on the sniper line if only with some longrange rocket fire but it's not enough not accurate enough so if you want to look at the turning point of the game it's not just this also it's what Dark and Fury is doing taking down canyon but really this has dismantled the game we see a little bit of pressure on the sides not quite fast enough but finally the team is starting to react the snipers remain you have 180 kills it's surreal you can see a damage efficiency of 356% from MKY but finally the snipers got a little bit too cocky saw the fact they just about in the base and they got taken out okay so now things are heating up so we're seeing these weird lightning turrets which look like literal pork look how nasty they look once they're expanded and we see the pawn launcher getting built so I love experimental units and the pawn launcher is getting built by our hero one chevoc on 64 metal second economy built by about three constructors which is impressive so it doesn't actually take that much to build it it's only 13 and a half thousand metal okay pull launcher is quite economical so the stream of units here mount the base so really we should be building walls out along this line here making sure no breaches happen but in saying that we got about three turtles which are enough to stop this spam line dead we got a mega kaggon or epic carth doing quite a good job against the spam so we're starting to see some pressure getting put on these walls we see a couple of breaks in the walls actually made by the epic grunt spam from [Laughter] Curtain epic grunt spam just cuz they're called grunts they do cost 6,000 metal please don't spam them like this up against snipers and banishers use a group charge would be much more effective okay now the walls have opened up we can now move through there that's why I recommend never completely blocking something off allow units to funnel in and direct all your defenses to take them out as they come in in a sort of narrow field of fire and also it allows a entrance for your units to go out and attack otherwise they're just going to run through your walls anyway but even then T3 units have a mind of their own will run through the walls cuz they don't recognize them so you have to put down some sort of defense a defense is not actually bad if you got experimenting against these dragon furies cuz you can't actually tell they're not T2 walls if you put them down thick enough they should save your walls from getting busted through by your T3 so here we can see a pretty big push happening from the south team looking to end this we've got the epic paw machine working at a million miles an hour the behemoth is coming down very slowly to respond to this but it's going to be difficult honestly for the south team to navigate red is just absolutely abused at the moment the behemoth taking down everything and hardly losing any hit points while doing so we see 50 kills already to the Behemoth the juggernaut also having about 66 kills but is mostly dead so the juggernaut's really good standoff unit whereas a behemoth can get in there eventually and do a lot so the epic pawn launcher is at work here up against the long range annoyances just not quite having the mass at any one time to do real damage but in saying that they cause friendly fire damage so if you can get the point right on to the building they're pretty good yeah see friendly fire damage took down that mech the assimulators here my new favorite unit by the way so it looks like an Amada experimental lab and the simulators right here so they're a purple unit so I got epic tumble weed epic porn meatball a rat which is actually pretty cool i prefer these and an epic recluse but the assimilator is underrated for what it does now they're not necessarily the cheapest unit for what they do they only got the DPS at 330 but their range and line of sight is about 800 combined with a high rate of fire they're just a really good utility unit if they can stay on that outside edge we can see them get to work here they're good against everything they're tanky enough to take a sniper hit with about 7 and 12,000 health and really they could have just rocked into this unsupported they have a critical enough mass of them look at all the snipers get cleaned up what else cleans up snipers like these guys nothing so if you can build about 10 of them they're really good against a sniper line but of course backed up by snipers now that helps so we can start to see now some T1 defense T1 walls get built as well from tech probably over the top south team's definitely got the edge at the moment now Sidian's upgraded from epic grunts to juggernaut better call the pawn launcher sort of not being used to its maximum utility that's for sure i'm just waiting for it to be used in the base here somewhere in the back to do its full extent of damage this simulator is just tearing things up they look so damn cool a took down the catapults so fast dragon gym coming in to save the day by the looks of it are they going to make it yeah the commander makes it that was very lucky 500 health left okay so we see a pawn finally get dropped here up against catapults look at this counter fire and that my friends is how you use a pger anywhere that's producing catapults just launch them near a friendly base that's That's how you take them out the best friendly fire incident I've ever seen not that it matters cuz we have this run by here from Trickster on the right i think it's all over for the North team now the big question is were walls the game winner here no they definitely weren't but in saying that they done okay they actually served their purpose of disincentivizing an attack pretty much the players here were locked up not knowing what to do against the walls it styied everyone and Canyon there were two players to take the beatings that did come through and then on this other side all the team's pressure came through this side and we saw a lot of stagnant units just sitting here i mean really that's earlier sniper line that could have perhaps made the game going a lot longer even turned around the game was effectively dealing with the walls but we just did not see that it was just too hard for this team that didn't know what to do how to get the visibility i mean in the end the pork is just surreal if you would have had these things mixed in with the walls a bit better this would have been an even better defense but as it is I don't think you'd be walking through this pork bastion anytime soon allowing that porn launcher to get up and running or any longrange artillery that you might choose honestly every noob lobby game I want to play I want to have experimental unsolve they're so cool all right on to the next one of this game of Supreme we can see we're in this exposed front position a coveted front position in this fire OS lobby i'm not experienced at this position but still we've managed to take a really good forward position here we've had a few runbys we've just barely stopped both of us and now we're starting to see all four players from both sides get in on the action actually if I want to quickly overview this we'll see Dasmo for whatever reason is keeping back a number of T1 units here yeah so we're outnumbered on the front and we're starting to really feel the pressure zab's brought up some Janice which has been immensely helpful but now we're up against Jianis unopposed we managed to have the defenses in place to throw it back and so we begin this blueprint of dragon's teeth orange showing the use of the Janis and Stouts very good combo unfortunately we got this very early banisher on the front line from blue the geospot sort of rush banisher i'm naturally wondering what the hell's hitting me at this time in combination with that so this is a little bit much for our T1 army at the moment and we're starting to get our guards demolished i'm not sure what's happening so I'm running around at the moment trying to support our neighbor but possibly the wrong move and my commander I just realized how much damage he's taken i'm surprised by it and now I see why it's the banisher so I'm thinking it's just Whistlers we're up against now I totally understand why I died i had no idea i thought I let the team down then which I did but it was the surprise banisher that done the damage sometimes worth it to actually see what sort of missiles are hitting you and to recognize what a banisher missile looks at cuz we can't see this it's always behind us also there's an obscure i can't even see it on the map although Orange recognizes a threat just about takes out both of them but gets their commander taken out in the process it was all the way back here so finally we see our Gio respond to this weapons over match and four versus three so if earlier would recognize that very early banisher play then I would have brought back the commander the whole reason of bringing forward those banishes is to try and snipe commanders actually that seemed to be the intent if we see what happened here the time was a very hard one to stomach cuz I thought I died to Whistlers that was quite negligent of me unfortunately cuz we have got beaten back I want to look at the opposing economies we're sitting on 12 metal a second they're sitting on 21 metal a second despite us trying to invest in our T1 economy at the current time that's the difference in owning this central spot and getting the mexes is the front two players get a really big advantage from that we're again building these dragons teeth at least it's an economical defense in the face of us barely having units i communicate that to my teammates who want me to build a green laser tower zaba says "Yes so what?" So just communicating that I don't have the economy for much at all a green laser tower isn't the most economical defense option as useful as it is against whistlers there's plenty of things which counter it including just tanks going up and smashing it it's not the be all and end all defense it has a marginal use in saying that I'm bringing one up anyway we can see 440 metal so this is a better part of a minute's whole medal spent from my economy look instantly dies to a persecutor sometimes when you're a more knowledgeable player like you're an OS39 so you think you have an advantage but you are taking a noob spot here not that there's anything wrong with that actually Zaba wanted to come up here and replace this just cuz you're an OS 39 doesn't mean your play style and how you play the game is going to be perfect for another player because we're working on a strategy of our own which is the static defenses and the rocket bots and they're doing a fine job of pushing back on all this damage look at this damage received we've got by far the most out of any player and we're holding our line the persecutor's really applying a lot of pressure as well and we're realizing how much we're in range of it so I'm getting up to building the second line of dragon's teeth to help us out here i am a little bit concerned by these whistlers so I agree it's a good unit to build i wasn't too sure where to build it now I'm pretty sure we can keep it up and living if I build it all the way back here look at how many rockets this dragon's teeth stopping phenomenal i mean five rocket bots should not be able to hold back 12 whistlers not at all so at least I guess we've got this overwatch if we do get a sudden rush on the dragon's teeth this will help defend it it's just really hard to build anything at the moment it's a bit of a laugh really when you defend the front two players particularly this player here to afford anything much at all it really is dependent on Pond and Gio to support their T2 economy and also it's a reason why we can't afford a T2 constructor so if we go over and look I mean look at all the metal this player has really should be donating it to us in a proper team game or at least spending it a bit faster so now despite the disparity of forces we've had a pretty remarkable break of 2 or 3 minutes yellow is just pinging the crap out of us cuz I missed them building a T2 mech i've never seen that done before usually you give the mech to the player usually sorry you give the T2 constructor to the player you don't just ping them over and over and build on their mixes i guess maybe this position's a little bit different it's always important to give other players agency controlling everything's just not possible and cuz it's not aligned with what I'm doing at the time can't just immediately action what they're doing i've got my own front I'm trying to handle here and observe what's going on and we see here yellow is not using these forces at all you know just letting this metal sit here with no pressure so it's fully on us at the moment with yellow's response just being to weapons overmatch and build a rattlesnake which is a good response still we can't afford that despite that we've got a 23 a second metal economy at the moment thanks to the windmills let me just pause this i usually wouldn't go over it but because we're in a little bit higher OS lobby we're assumed to be a bit of the nuber player and Zaba because I didn't action it right away says "Are you paying attention?" And then Sark comes in and says "He has given up." So this isn't the worst bullying that I'm receiving and I did miss this T2 mech here cuz I was up here microing my units let's look at some stats here apart from the navy player we're by far leading the damage received we're getting a lot more pressure we're not necessarily able to give it back because I've only got some rocket bots here but I've had to preserve what little I've had while trying to build this little T1 economy and because I'm flicking back and forth here I'm not necessarily actioning these right away in saying that I did miss this one i mismicroed it i got my constructor rather than a constructor turret to start building it but we've since rectified that and I basically actioned these right away but because of that one misstep it's assumed on being useless and this is a high pressure game and I understand but the issue is with it it's something called mobbing and once you're aware of it I hope these players stop doing it it's something that us humans do you'll have one player hassling and pinging a lot and everyone's getting annoyed at the pinging because there's apparently something I'm not doing and then they'll assume there's something wrong with me but what's wrong is is Zaber is not giving me a T2 constructor but still it's a bit harsh and that's why I push back on it and I say "Cut out the bully." It's just mobbing is when another player piles in and says "Yeah do your job." And they're a little bit mean or whatever it is and it's just not accurate if you do see what is perceived as bullying in a bar game I encourage you to actually not add to it either way so fortunately Red's come in and providing some assistance we see this over here as well red has done quite well with some cruisers and battleships with a T2 navy of helping out the front line hot dog being quite aware of the difficult position we're in and what it is also is I'm feeling pretty bad cuz I got my commander blown up before but as I can see now I've rewatched the replay it's just something which is a little bit left field and now I can understand why it wasn't negligence why my commander got blown up it's saying that orange's commander also got popped so so hot dog communicates to us front weakens significantly spam right on Q we're putting through spam we recognize that ourselves that it's time to scout forward and put additional pressure so rather than eat up our T1 factory we're just converting it into a spam factory even before we begin the T2 the best way to help out our team at the moment is produce this spam right on the front the gunslingers been a marvelous unit dasmo showing us what it's all about they're really quite impressive and I do love seeing ambassadors get their comeuppants austa the commander is down so the reason we're winning this game is we've won both sieves and that's just too bad for the enemy front despite their early excellent pressure if you lose the seas it's very hard to hang on so despite some good pushes from the north team it's pretty much all over the north team actually holds on quite nicely dasmos commander goes down targeted by the bombers i'm going to show quickly what we're able to build here so here we go we're putting down the blueprints over on the right hand side enemy air really seems to have won the air battle takes a reasonable time to build each of these T2 wall segments i'm wondering if this third line of walls is probably a little bit overkill the two is good enough also we might need to build a second construction turret to just hurry this construction along a bit and help out with the repairs we win this so we're not going to see these tested we can see it looks like a fairly formidable defense would take a fairly solid initial attack not going to necessarily take much in the way of abuse from ambassadors and such but what defense is maybe just space out the beamers slightly still might stop the super big T3 anyway and just have the rattlesnake back a little bit further and maybe incorporate two construction turrets and a jammer so that's what I might modify i'm not going to release the blueprints yet i'm going to update it and it'll have the better version i'll let you guys know once it's up in this game we've been able to get up to the 3.2 Metal Extractor pretty fast despite some runbys and some aggression behind us causing a little bit of mayhem we've been able to eco out quite nicely all things considered and we're starting to see the aggression here at the six-minute time with the Whistlers finally pushing forward and we've been able to get up pretty much all our defenses and now we're getting up to this new wall blueprint giving it a real good test i'm quite happy with our position the fact it's so far forward means we should get a lot of use out of it so definitely a job for our commander here so we clear out that laser tower to enable us to continue building it and we're going to try and really contest against these Whistlers and not fall back too much despite taking a couple of casualties or one so the unfortunate thing about the Whistlers they've got the really good line of sight we can see that again we're off against Leafer and can exactly aim at our commander but even then they shot one rocket at the commander and it actually hit the dragon's teeth so I'm just being a little bit conservative with the commander and pushing back we can also see this laser turret basically controlling the area here just barely so we have got a bit of a weak spot here but not much we can do about it for the moment as we've got to push back on Leaf's aggression whatever reason I don't recognize I'm getting hit by this laser out of the mids trying to do too many things at once so we just move to the left and dance around a little bit and that gets us out of the view we can just see how at this position how good the rockets actually are or the dragon's teeth actually are taking a huge amount of damage here they took forever to take down that one bot we didn't have to dance around much at all we could pretty much sit behind these dragons tooth and tank all day they're finally getting the angle on this rocket bot here as they move to the sides we push back with some pawns we built try and take down this annoying guard so that's one way Leaf has worked out to navigate past the dragon's teeth is to move down the flank here usually this wouldn't be an option but unfortunately we've got very poor support from our teammate here okay we've got the rocketeers here and 28 of them on the screen these ones not getting used at all by finel so really allowing us to have a very comfortable existence here behind the walls perhaps the walls having their effect of not inviting any sort of attack it's too hard to bother with Leaf's pressure being pretty abysmal we see these whistlers now all beaten up if we look over I feel it's been abysmal but still leading the damage on the board we've been able to hold this off very easily and we're second behind Kurdian for metal produced so that shows you we've been able to eco up quite comfortably while utilizing rocket bots and this super cheap dragon's teeth rather than building artillery this game we're just going for an overwash to help out with the defense feeling pretty secure okay so just randomly we move forward i detect a little bit of weakness and red trying to push the eco in up too far unfortunately all these troops haven't been pressured and we've just got an amazing standing army sitting here and we see our teammates withdraw i must look away for a section here and don't perfectly micro this at all just face tank with my rocket bots they're actually not the worst at just sort of rolling up and trading the Brockabots have got okay stats better than what you'd think but still you're not going to win that fight no way we see that now with not the best damage efficiency but still 80% and the fact a lot of that damage efficiency is our dragon's teeth getting hit that's counted so we've now thrown away our defenses stupidly and let's see if we can hold on definitely should not have attacked with those rocket bots or micro them a lot better okay I'm alerting the team that I'm going to need help so nothing to push back now on Leaf's Whistlers and Caesar gets a bit of Dutch courage moving down we called for help a little while ago we see blue move out our overwatch supported for a little bit long enough for them to lock in place and get our commander around for a D gun kbot finally moving out so thank God we've had light blue here to support us a bat tootssie and a very minimal defense in the end we've been able to basically reclaim a heap of metal my gigantic mistake wasn't too badly punished in throwing away those rock bots just in case though I'm just got this commander stationary here see a pretty typical timing here from Leafer who I might have suspect has watched a guide of mine attacking with mouths at the 15minute mark after building whistlers though no Janice so perhaps not now going into ambassadors not really called for cuz we don't have traditional defenses but still the ambassadors can be a good hit and run unit all you need to do is get a little bit lucky we see the fake back and forth being able to sucker the mouses in almost get taken down by the ambassador missile can really punish them and look at that that ambassador missile oh man that was a very good estimation on where we'd end up so a good player can use the ambassadors on any predictable pathing again hits us that was a couple of really good hits from Leafer i'm going to implore I know the reason why there's no anti-rocket unit but I really do implore the bar developers to develop something even if it's expensive because otherwise if you get a good enough player they can just sit off with ambassadors and just snipe you all day with very little metal spent which doesn't seem right to me it doesn't sit right yesesh that ambassador hits and also that's the one issue with dragon's teeth of course any static defenses I get here against an effective ambassador player worse and useless but at least the dragon's teeth we have some defense in the face of it so I can position units behind there in a crunch so if we had more aggressive dragon's teeth coming up we'd be able to sit behind it with the hounds at times see fortunately some push back on red here from the air gotten some minor eco damage at some point keeping up with the hound attack found an AFK commander on the front line that's what we want always dangerous to leave a commander on the front line approaching the 20-minute mark yeah after the 15minute mark it's dangerous an aggressive drive at us so I'm trying to protect the radar and jammer a little bit cuz I know these guys aren't going to stop they're just going to hunt me down no matter what being able to come in around these dragons teeth also forcing the tanks to come on this circumnavigated path so I'm not sure if the hounds can actually fit through this very close in the end we're sitting up there as the top damage though so we're exacting a lot of pressure despite the mistakes i think we're going okay and we're second by far in metal produced only of course Kurdian who's a really good player is outdoing us an attack here just on these stagnant forces i see the lines a little bit weak but still it's surprising how good it is this T2 mix we see a bit of a response by Jaguars wasn't quite able to overcome it done a fair bit of damage we're just poking forward keeping up the pressure now this is the blueprint we're going to really test out and I'm not sure is going to work well but this is a contested front line we've created a lot of heat and we've got Starlights up against us so we got this rattlesnake in a pretty forward position they're having to sit right back so this is annoying to them and Red Leafer has shown they know how to use ambassadors the ambassador's moving forward to take down my rattlesnake now I imagine yep unfortunately I don't have the forces to push forward oh they're down here i'm just off doing something else so it takes me a little bit by surprise and this defense no matter what you do it's never going to fight off ambassadors there's no defensive unit which can do it so we just have to take that in our stride i think it's bloody awful by the way i think it's bloody awful you can't counter those rockets whatsoever otherwise I'd build it it's just such a meta thing to build the ambassadors even if it's only I don't know 50% accurate it's just something to specifically target rockets also from banishes as well their rockets can be extremely annoying i don't know if it's going to be a hill all die on in advocating for it but I just think there needs to be some sort of unit which diminishes the power of them otherwise in the future all you're going to see is these ambassador wars like throughout T2 there's going to be ambassadors there's going to be banishes yeah there's going to be shivers they've got the rockets so this tremor here comes forward and is going to hassle them as I push forward unfortunately into the tremor but taking a toll all of a sudden so not the worst attack now unfortunately a lot of friendly fire those tremor hits just pop the hounds quite amazing or perhaps it was the vanguards here no it was probably the vanguards so we're up against all the different long range problems and this is at the 25minute mark we get in a heap of vanguards at least vanguards have got a counter in shields although I'm just out of funds at the 25 minute mark to build it now I've been pressuring we've been taking heaps of damage and building static defenses and eco just nothing really left for shields at the moment so it's amazing really this tremor is still alive it will get taken down very shortly I think there we go so we can see this decent attack now starlights onto our prepared defenses fortunately we have this pulsar to replace the rattlesnake that was taken down before we can see these defenses working pretty well against the attack unfortunately this pawn manages to hide while providing sight to the start lights so I've been able to finally get the angle on that pawn so a disadvantage of this but look at all these Starlight hits are hitting our walls wow i don't know if it's cuz it's on the hill but that's working really well unfortunately they take down my commander yeah so we we turned it back this pulsar was able to fend off the starlights easily a decent line of them and a big heap of spam that had visibility on us so to me that is proof positive of this defense the pulsail was able to shoot over the top of it the rattlesnake as well the beam is to some degree cuz this is a thicker defense so you can get units hide behind it but if you have your own spam to sort of counter those hiders it's okay and it really counters the starlight beams at least on the hill here i can't say for 100% whether it will counter a starlight beam in all scenarios but I think it's a pretty good chance of it and if you put your pulsar a little bit further back that might help as well again anti-rockets and look an anti-rocket unit would only be marginal use against a catapult cuz there's such a swarm of them i think that's fair i think the catapult because it's just such a one use unit and you've got to really manually control it i consider it fair that it is pretty powerful and it's T3 and it's expensive so you know all that's fine but just to have zero counter there should be something i get the counter argument i really do you need to give some advantages to the attacker otherwise people just turtle up till the nth degree but I think if you got something which only half counted it I think that would be fair it just gives your defenses a little bit more survivability rather than just being panced in the first volley all the time even from a lowly amount of catapults yeah some sort of Gatling gun which fires up at these rockets just seems like a massive oversight to not have that unit i dare say anything anti-air should be able to target at a certain accuracy those rockets we now see these gunships come up to us look at all the beamers go not a chance so for some reason our T2 constructor got killed off here and we're not seeing our fabulous blueprint fully up to speed although we are getting one up here unfortunately we can see Leafer has really manned up this hill and can effectively hide up from us we're up against about seven vanguards which is not ideal for our static defenses now it's at the half an hour mark and unfortunately I've remissed on building shields i'm not sure if shields would have been enough against seven perhaps three shields i guess I feel because we're so far behind in the amount of vanguards that are against us with no real way to respond to them the shields are not a good use of resources also because of the constant pressure I'm stuck on T2 which is a bit sad only now I'm starting on T3 so finally the Pulsar is taken down but for whatever reason the Vanguards withdraw we're getting outflanked unfortunately in a massive way curtian I think from Vanguards himself just got beaten back and very good play from the yellow player avadable rare that would have been about the first time I've seen Kurtie get rolled up also got a nuke attack on his base it was just a series of bad luck for Kurtian oh this is brutal don't tell us the Aphus goes down 6% health left is that going to hit it 4% oh no there we go something weird hit it oh no it was this one vanguard sniped it oh we can see a lot of tech was taken out then too so even though we've managed to hold off the enemy here with you know support from our friends against really difficult opposition yeah we got our flanked the catapult is sort of using these walls as cover fortunately doesn't seem to be able to walk over them which is nice maybe it's only the super large T3 which can do that another attack from air coming hard at our newly constructed Ragnarok this is what I mean yeah even though we have a fair number of AO it's almost not enough and particularly against these dragons very good against anti-air the fight is absolutely needed so now we're responsible for the Ragnarok's defense on top of everything else despite being badly badly outflanked you can see just getting cut up here by shivers for whatever reason and I really can't understand this we're leading the damage i'm not sure what we're doing i'm pretty much just welders and snipers i think we already would have resigned if it wasn't for this Ragnarok just fulllorn hope we can see some reasonable damage to the enemy base actually but we're so set back with what happened over here it's unbelievable and this team just won't stop attacking us there's no one who seems to be able to really take control here and I see why now cuz we have our one chev doing a remarkable job for a one chev and Georgia three on the tech so just too weak on this side to really deal with it and on the other side our canyon's not able to affect a breakthrough the walls being very bot friendly just allowing them to pass through and you can sort of see it's defining the battlefield if we want to look out here the walls here to some degree are stopping any sort of aggression on our side they're stopping it here so it's funneling through their attacks this way and some down here with our forces getting beaten back on both sides we do see the vanguards unfortunately mount the hill here almost unassalable position for us to attack backed by more vanguards to punish any maneuvering forces i think that's pretty much it like the Ragnarok we would have won it if it wasn't for the Vanguard advantage i think it's OP unit versus OP unit yeah it goes on a fair bit longer this game actually we managed to hold on i think we've seen the capacity of what walls can do for us cuz in the face of endless vanguards walls you know never going to do much at least without a lot of shielding on it which we can't afford overall I'm pretty happy how they performed they done their job they allowed us to get pretty much one of the top eos on the team despite getting a really high damage throughout and pressure very close game so yeah I like these new blueprints guys highly recommend so walls what do I think of them what's my analysis of them what am I excited about i'm excited about our innovation with how we could mix up a couple of blueprints other players might have used similar blueprints before i don't know but I've never seen them in the game so go to my website download these blueprints i'll have the link in the description and it will be part of my blueprints file that I actually use these straight dragons teeth are absolutely fine for protecting your troops they're great don't get me wrong but they do block your rocket bots so if a rocket bots want to go out to attack they're all the time going to have to go around the side and what do they do they bunch up so any artillery that's hitting you Ganis etc it speeds down your reaction time so spacing them out to allow your rock bots to move through them is a million times better the one thing I was worried about was would it block enough yes it would only when the enemy forces could get around the sides here would they tend to shoot through the walls at your rocket bots but you should have something over here anyway shouldn't you so yeah something to be aware of and you just might have to change the angles it was even worth it to sit with your rocket bots directly behind them which you can space them out and just leave them there that's fine then every single time the walls would tend to block the rockets and then you could micro them back out if they needed to move forward for any reason second innovation was we created a checkerboard defense i will be changing this up and modifying this slightly in my blueprint because it's a little bit over the top but still it was very good at stopping a bunch of projectiles coming through and hitting it it allows us to sneak out various units including the T2 constructor itself through this wall and it has the laser tower spine here to stop T3 units including friendly ones mega T3 units from just crunching through the walls sort of obsoleting them i've seen blueprints before or I've seen walling of let's say pulsars before where they directly wall around pulsar it might do the same job but to me it's a little bit more inefficient to do that also it doesn't lead to the most psychologically important function of walls and which I've observed is to create this attack void where people will look at your set of walls here and we'll just always seek to go around it which we can plan into and create little funnels for the units to get attacked with with either our static forces or our armies and if we look over canyon here this is the most extreme example of it is we might completely block this off we might completely block this off completely block this off it invites attack through here or around here and we can plan for that essentially with T2 walls in the later game we have a T2 wall that's not completely blocked but looks scary here what's that going to do well it's going to force the attacks around here or around here which might suit us and we can move our army here or here to pressure and you don't even need a complete wall off it just needs to be scary and the enemy to realize that their units are having issue getting through the walls and then they want to move around them what's the disadvantages of walls well there are a couple one of them I thought they would have protected the towers a bit better but as we can see here the towers are much taller than the dragon's teeth so the dragon's teeth which are T1 wall does not protect the T1 defenses but then we see this when firing at units it actually does hit the dragon's teeth even though we can't see it on the radar still continues to fire upwards on an upwards trajectory and I'm not sure if that's in the unit's memory but I'm pretty sure it's going to always fire up despite being on radar at the T1 defense so really making walls for a T1 defense is a complete waste of time what I've have observed also is even the dragon's claw gets shot over the dragon's teeth tell me in the comments if you've observed differently but it's seems to suffer from the same effect despite being much closer to the ground maces have a much easier time firing over the dragon's teeth showing there is a use case for maces in assaulting prepared defenses sometimes the rocket still get through and finds these gaps in your dragon's teeth sometimes it'll even hit your construction turrets it will fire over them it seems 50/50 on that but they'll always manage to fire at your T1 defenses yeah so we observe that it quite often is actually getting through to the construction turret this might be the diagonal wall allows the odd rocket to come through whereas a completely horizontal wall if you want it or adjacent wall this will tend to stop all the rockets it's important to note also that walls won't auto repair so over time you might actually have to rebuild them otherwise you're going to have breaks like this so we can see here T2 walls defend against a variety of projectiles even the gunslinger when firing at the T1 defenses so the T2 walls actually defend the T1 defenses if we were to perhaps put a pitbull though behind these walls and also a dragon's claw it won't be able to fire over these higher walls so counterintuitively we have to build the T1 defenses instead and here we see the walls doing a standup job against normal rocket pots of course they can put up with quite a bit of abuse here's a general tank attack now also struggling to fire over the T2 walls and far off the the stouts do actually manage to shoot behind the walls if they get a little bit closer the T2 walls will stop them so it's dependent on a number of factors like this one that's a little bit closer despite trying to arc up the projectile that's not quite working the thugs having exactly the same problem against the T2 walls dragon's teeth they are fine but now that wall is stopping them quite a bit at all sorts of ranges we can see that here it's not actually hitting centurions it's not working either as we expect so let's test this defensive bastion here with a pretty big force that we've managed to build up a mixture of T1 and T2 units and right away we see arbiters even on our friendly fire side start to a trip on the pulsars or on the beam lasers sorry the beamers let's pause this let's just see how these more diagonal walls go catching the projectiles funnily enough diagonal walls don't seem to catch as many is what I've noticed pretty much all those got through from the bulls etc but despite being very close they took down the beams very fast there you go guys diagonal walls not as good so let's see how blue goes with this attack on the straighter walls here certainly these beamers are pretty scary when you get enough of them in a row a lot of rockets are hitting the walls we've seen a number of projectiles go over them still but not every projectile the Janice what's that going to do it actually hits the walls pretty much everything but I think the bulls I think the bulls do a pretty good job of shooting over the walls with their plasma the starlights shoot into them at extreme ranges the maces do a reasonable job at shooting over the T2 walls but as soon as they get closer not so much i think the fat boys are going to be just fine getting in over the walls here if they can get to the walls damn goes to show just a couple of units being outside the walls good against deploy them against fat boys cuz I'm pretty sure the fat boys would just smash these and the final attack we'll look at here is another attack by red onto the diagonal walls yeah the bulls just shooting right over the walls at extreme ranges the artillery shell gets right in over the walls anything which can stand off and not completely direct fire has a bit better time at it but I am noticing at all sorts of ranges tank rounds are getting over the diagonal walls for whatever reason they don't seem as good only really stopping the projectiles that are right up against them which is still useful like these beamers are lasting longer than they would have otherwise is this going to stop it yeah so good against Janisfi but of course the T2 walls is going to rarely see that problem in multiplayer games the Janis shot here actually gets over the diagonal walls at this place i think it also depended on where they shoot and the angle they're on and lastly as a last service the walls funnels the units here into this killing field that if we did have area of attack weapons would really punish this grouping up and here as well overall I like what walls bring to the game i think they're the one way you can actually change the terrain or the pathing as it were it can also give the enemy advantage if they overrun your walls they can then use them for defense of course but allows you to survive a onslaught of artillery and then at least you've got some infrastructure to come back to and build some static defenses again behind the walls makes the static defense a lot more survivable against a variety of units and of course your own units as well if you have units which can shoot over the walls and they don't then that's of course a massive advantage walls obviously are going to be very useful at the line of conflict so as forward as they can be is going to be very useful for you but even if they're back in defense that allows you to have a fallback position if you have limited forces compared to theirs the biggest negative of walls is improperly used they're a bit of a waste of resources they block in your forces where they otherwise wouldn't and so you need to try and mitigate that they cost a fair bit of metal if you overbuild them these T2 walls takes a lot of build power metal and a little bit of energy to build they've got terrible line of sight at one so don't rely on them for that yeah so I think if you deploy them through blueprints and use a checkerboard spacing that helps save some money perhaps by providing even if only partial defense we can have more spaced out checkerboard spacing right and at least it's going to stop some of the direct fire damage so might be worth thinking about yeah something which I encourage you to play around with and if you have any findings get back to me if you improve upon my blueprints certainly let me know all right guys hope you found this informative today any further tips please leave them in the comments if you enjoyed the video let me know make sure you subscribe
